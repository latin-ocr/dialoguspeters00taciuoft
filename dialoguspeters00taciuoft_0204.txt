colebant, hos et praeturae et consulatus vocare ultro videbantur,
hi ne privati quidem sine potestate erant, cum et populum et

senatum consilio et auctoritate regerent.

Quin immo sibi

25 persuaserant neminem sine eloquentia aut adsequi posse in

civitate aut tueri conspicuum et eminentem locum: nec mirum,
cum etiam inviti ad populum producerentur, cum parum esset in
senatu breviter censere, nisi quis ingenio et eloquentia sententiam
suam tueretur, cum in aliquam invidiam aut crimen vocati sua
30 voce respondendum haberent, cum testimonia quoque in iudiciis

their numerous clientelle included even
foreign states. Hi refers, of course, to
‘qui plurimum dicendo poterant?

22. vocare ultro. Office and emolu-
ment ‘beckoned them,’ without any solici-
tation on their part.

24. consilio et auctoritate. Similarly
Germ. xii. 10 centeni singulis ex plebe
comites consilium simul et auctoritas
adsunt.

Quin immo. Nay more, eloquence
was considered (videbantur, ll. 7 and
16) not only serviceable and profitable
but even indispensable to public men:
cp. below ‘necessitas accedebat.’—With-
out ipsi, the subject to persuaserant is
not the professional orators alone, but
the antiqui generally, as also in what
follows. The insertion of ipsi (probably
due to some sort of dittography) seems to
create a salse antithesis between the
general opinion of the antiqui and the
views attributed to those who recognized
in the profession of oratory the best pass-
port to office.

26. tueri . . . locum, of ‘ holding one's
ground ' : cp. honores tueri, 37. 4.

27. producerentur, viz. on the rostra
in the forum. The meaning is, it was
quite natural and intelligible that elo-
quence should come to be regarded as
indispensable for the ‘ cursus honorum 'z
even in less official situations the need for

it was often felt. Then follows a regular ,

sequence of (1) public assemblies (ad
populum), (2) meetings of senate
(in senatu), and (3) courts of law,
either (a) as defendant (invidiam . . .
crimen), or (b) as a witness (testimonia
quoque).

parum esset.. cp. 23. 15.

28. censere. For this absolute use,
cp. Ann. i. 74, 19 ‘quo’ inquit ‘loco
censebis, Caesarz‘ 3 xii. 9, 6. Hist. iv.
8, 2. F'or the thought, cp. 41.13 Quid
enim opus est longis in senatu sententiis,
cum optimi cito consentiant?

nisi quis, &Q This does duty for
a co-ordinate adversative clause: tr. ‘ No,
one had to support one's opinion,'-—that
is to say, if one had any pretensions to
rank as a statesman. A similar redun-
dancy of expression has been noted on
34. 11 ubi nemo impune . . . quominus, &c.
In such cases (especially common with
⁶ non satis habere‚’ ‘non satis est ’) the
tendency is to express the thought both
positively and negatively, for emphasis:
among many other examples given
by Vahlen, cp. Cic. pro Rosc. Am. ᾗ 49 ut
parum miseriae sit quod aliis coluit, non
sibi, nisi etiam quod omnino coluit crimini
fuerit: Ter. Phormio, 724 non satis est
tuum te officium fecisse, id si non fama
adprobat: to which Binde adds Sen. Ep.
89, 203 Quint. v. 10, 12 z and John, from
the Greek, Hom. Od. xi. 158 τὸν οὔπως ἔστι
περῆσαι πεζὸν ἐόντ’, ἢν μή τις ἔχῃ εὐεργέα
νῆα; ib. xvi. 196: Soph. An'tig. 308:
Xen. Cyrop. vii. 5. 75.

29. invidiam aut crimen. Cp. Hist.
iii. 75. 15 invidiam crimenque, where
however there is more of a hendiadys- - the
odium and the charge which incurred it·
here rather‘ defamation (unpopularity) or
some definite charge!

sua. voce respondendum haberent,

‘to surrender personally‚' to appear in
person in answer to a legal summons.
