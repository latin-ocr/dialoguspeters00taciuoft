birth his biographers have been able to arrive approximately by a process
of inference. He tells us in the ffi'storz'es (i. 1) that his official career
began under Vespasian, and that he received promotion from both Titus
and Domitian. This must mean that he was quaestor in the first-
mentioned reign, and either tribune or 'aedile under Titus: while we
know that he held the praetorship in A.D. 88. Titus reigned from June
79 to September 81 3 and, as it is improbable that more than one year
intervened between his tenure of the two lower officeS, we may infer that
Tacitus was quaestor in either 78 or 79. A necessary qualification for
this office was that a candidate should have attained his twenty-fifth year,
so that we may take it that the year of his birth must be fixed at An). 53
or 54. This would make him about twenty at the date at which he was
present as a listener when the conversation reported in the Dialogus took
place: a time of life which agrees admirably with the phrase iuvenis
admodum. If, with others, we adopt the year 56 as the date of his
birth, he may have been two years younger: and either supposition suits
the description which he gives of himself as a follower of two of the most
famosis of contemporary pleaders, Aper and Secundus (2. 6).

The next point to be settled, on the theory that Tacitus wrote the
Dialogue, is the date at which it was composed and published. Here the
views of the critics diverge, as we have already seen, very considerably.
Many of them have given undue weight to the passage in the Agricola in
which Tacitus refers to Domitian's reign as a period during which ‘the
young have passed to old age, with closed lips, and the old almost to the
very goal and term of life ¹.' From the phrase per silentium it has been
inferred that Tacitus cannot have written anything of any kind in the
reign of Domitian, and the conclusion drawn has been that the Dz'alogue
must have been composed either in the reign of Titus or else after
Domitian's death, about the same time as the other minor works. But in
the passage under consideration, Tacitus is speaking as a historian who
(though he. may have been industriously collecting material in the evil
days which had now corne to a close) is hailing a happier era as per-
mitting him at length to break the silence into which he had been
coerced. It is quite conceivable that, whether published or not at the
time of composition, such a work as the Dz‘alogue might have been written
in the earlier and brighter years of Domitian's reign. Too much has no
doubt been made of the necessity of postulating a considerable interval
between the time at which the conversation took place and the time at
which the treatise was composed, in order to account sor the use of the
