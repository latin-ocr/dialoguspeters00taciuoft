lvi INTRODUCTION.

47, 1; insignitior iii. 70, 103 metuentior xiii. 25, 15, and many other
instanceS. 'Among more or less peculiar uses of adjectives may be
noted fecundus 33. 5 (ficundissima eorum studia: cp. Quintilian’s phrase
studiorum fructus x. 3, 2 ; xii. 6, 3; 11, 4); beatus 9. 193 altus 14. 3
(altior sermo, i.e. gravior sermo: cp. Quint. iii. 8, 42 altior quaestio): also
the personal construction with manifestus 16. 11. The peculiar use of the
future participle may also be mentioned here: see on mansurum 9. 22.

As to Pronomae, the use of hic with reference to contemporary
circumstances is characteristic both of Tacitus and Quintilian: see on
28. 93 32. 13, and cp. 37. 63 Germ. iii. 3, XX. 1. Instances of·et ipse
occur 30. 1 and 37. 15.

In regard to verbe, it is well known that Tacitus shows a growing
tendency to prefer simple forms to their corresponding compounds.
Here are a few examples. Adsuescere occurs Dial. 20. 9 3 34. 6 ; Agr.
xvi. 19; xxi. 33 Germ. iv. 8: suescere, Ann. ii. 44, 23 52. 43 xiv. 27, 8.
Adiuvare‚ Dz'al. 16. 7 ; Agr. xxi. 4: iuvare, IIzst. v. 23, 53 Ann. ii. 78,
9. Innotescere, Dial. 10. 5; Hist. iv. 50, 2, whereas notescere is the form
used ,in the Annals. Demonstrare occurs four times in the Dialogue,
e. g. 7. 17: in the Agricola and Germania the simple form is found as
frequently. The author’s preference, in the Dialogue, for compound
forms is made an argument for the retention of depacaverat 38 ad fin„
where see note. Cp. the frequent use in the Annals of paratus for
apparatus (Dial. 22. 21). On the other hand we have in the Dialogus

 

flexisse 19. 4; finire (for definire) 38. 6 ; cludere 30. 26 ; pensare 40 ad ἱ

fin.; vanescere 10. 25; ferre (for efferre) 19. 173 fateri 17. 17; 32. 9:
cp. also 25. 9: while a few cases are doubtful, as sequitur— insequitur 10. 3,
and perhaps hortatur—exhortatur 14. 9.

It is hardly necessary to illustrate the development of the usage by
which compound verbs take a simple accusative instead of a prepositional
construction: cp. however antecedere 25. 15; praecurrere 25. 5, and see
Draeger ξ 40.

The frequent use of the perfect subjunctive, in modest assertions, is
also to be noted, e.g. timuerim 13. 23 cesserit 13. 103 dixerim 32. 22;
vocaverim 18. 43 non negaverim 26. 14 ; Draeger § 28. So even ut sic
dixerim 34. 83 40. 19.

Among other peculiarities may be mentioned a certain preference for
the plural verb even in cases where it is used with two antithetical
nominatives, e.g. 42. 6 Ego te poetis, Messalla autem antiquariis crz‘ntt'tta·
bimur. In other writerS, the verb naturally follows the number of the
second nominative. Cp. stt. ii. 30, 14 Caecina ut foedum ac macu-
losum, ille ut tumidum ac vanum inridebant: so censuere, Ann. i. 8, 14;
