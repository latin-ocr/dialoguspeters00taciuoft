DIALOGUS

DE ORATORIBUS

 

1. SAEPE ex me requiris, Iuste Fabi, cur, curn priora saecula
tot eminentium oratorum ingeniis gloriaque floruerint, nostra
potissimum aetas deserta et laude eloquentiae orbata vix nomen
ipsum oratoris retineat; neque enim ita appellamus nisi anti-
quOS, horum autem temporum diserti causidici et advocati et 5

patroni et quidvis potius quam oratores vocantur.

Cui percon-

tationi tuae respondere et tam magnae quaestionis pondus ex-

Ghs. 1, 2, Introductory—Tlce visit to
Maternus.

1. 1. Iuste Fabi. Fabius Justus was
'a friend of Pliny the Younger‚ who ad-
dresses to him at least one of his letters,
i. 11 z possibly also vii. 2. There is also
a reference to him in Ep. i. 5, 8. Nothing
more is known of him, though he may be
identical with the L. Fabius Justus who
was consul in 102 Α. D. For the inversion
of nomen and cognomen (the praenomen
being omitted), cp. 13. 9 ‘ Secundus Pom·
ponius,’ and ‘ Afro Domitio.’ The usage
is characteristic of the Silver Age, and is
especially common in Quintilian (e. g. Χ.
1, 55 86, 87, 103) ; but it seems to have
been first introduced by Varro (L. Lat. 5,
83 ‘ Scaevola Quintus' τ De Re Rust. i. 2, 1
‘ Libo Marcius ’) , and is found in Cicero (de
Or. ii. 5 253)—frequently in his Letters.
Cp. Draeger 5 221.

2. eminentium: cp. 36. 26, 25. 7:
Ann. i. 80, 8.

3. deserta, ‘ barren‚’ used absolutely.
The figure is the same as that contained
1n floruerznt

4. oratoris. Cp. 15. 5cum.. .neminem
hoc tempore oratorem esse contenderes,
where see note. So, of the perfect orator,
Cic. de Or. 1 5 64 is orator erit mea senten·
tia hoc tam gravi dignus nomine qui, διο.

5. diserti. The word is often used of
‘ elever speakers‚' as an antithesis to
eloquens and orator. So Cicero quotes
(Or. 5 18) a saying of Antonius, disertos
ait se vidisse multos, eloquentem omnino
neminem: cp. de Or. i. 5 94: Quint. xii.
1, 23 (malum virum summe disertum . . .
donabimus oratoris illo sacro nomine),
and i. 10, 8 (‘ fuit aliquis sine his disertus ':
‘ at ego oratorem volo ’).

causidici et advocati et patroni.
These terms indicate the restriction of
oratory to the sphere of judicial proce-
dure, especially in the centumviral courts,
which in former days ‘splendore aliorum
iudiciorum obruebantur ’ (38. 11). Com-
pared with the true orator, the causi-
dicus, or ‘pleaden’ was nothing but a
‘litium advocatus’ (Quint. xii. 1, 25).
Hence the tone of contempt with which
the word is used, as of a pettifogging
attorney, in such passages as Cic. de Or.
i. 5 202: Juv. vi. 439⁴ nec causidicus nec
praeco loquetur’ : with which cp. Petro-
nius xlvi. ad fin., and Burmann’s note.
Advocatus frequently has the sense of
‘ counsel' in Quintilian, Pliny the Younger,
and Suetonius: so also Ann. xi. 5, 5. For
the older meaning of the word see on 34.1 2.

6. quidvis: e.g. actores, 26. 7.

7. pondus excipere. More usual
