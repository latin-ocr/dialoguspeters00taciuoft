HVSp. and Put., which agree also in a similar omission at 35. 13—15 con-
troversiae [ex his suasoriae . . . . controversiae] ; 36. 6 imbui for tribui; 36. 7

On the other hand, the following differences may be noted, caused by
significant omissions in H :—

9. 3 suis Sp., om. H 3 19 ad fin. et festinare se testantur VSp. Put., om.
H; 20. 15 invicem Sp. Put., om. H 3 20. 18 decor Sp. Put., om. H; 21. 23

invicem VSp., om. H; 31. 24 proficiet Sp., om. H ; 35. 11 et audiantur
VSp., orn. H.

The following are interesting examples of those transpositions (repro-
duced in early editions) which frequently occur in manuscriptS, especially
where the collocation is a familiar one (cp. note on velut quadam,
5. 23) :—

10. 2 sui laboris3 13. 7 versibus Vergilii3 18. 4 antiquos merit03 25. 29

35. 9 imperitus aeque3 40. 16 Athenienses plurimi.

For the rest, it is noticeable that H, while in general agreement with
the Y family, shares with D a leaning to AB, especially the former. In
the places cited by Scheuer on pp. 29, 30, where ABD differ from
EV2CA, H is generally in agreement with ABD. On the whole, the
study of its peculiarities confirms the impression that neither of the two
families is to be blindly followed, and that the restoration of the true
text must be secured by an eclectic method. The divergences already
tabulated may suggest to some a theory that there may have been more
than one archetype, and that Enoch’s codex is not the only one from
which the text has been derived. But the strongest possible proof of the
common origin of all existing MSS. is furnished by the occurrence in all
of them of the lacuna noted in the text at the end of ch. 35. Some have
thought that the portion of the treatise here omitted is of no very considerable
extent, and may even have consisted of only a few lines; but all the
