Maternus points the contrast between the forensic oratory of republican
times and that of his own day, we seem to recognize a tone more
eminently characteristic of Tacitus than of any contemporary writer: cum in
plerisque iudiciis crederet populus Romanus sua interesse quid iudicaretur,
39. 18.

The influence exerted ‚on the style of the Dialogue by the various
writers of whom Tacitus was at the time an enthusiastic student, might be
shown at length, and haS, in fact, been proved by editors in almost excessive
detail. Reference has already been made to Cicer-0, with whose workS‚
especially the rhetorical treatiseS‚ he was obviously well-acquainted. Even
in his choice of the literary form of his treatise, Tacitus was no doubt
influenced by Cicero's successful imitations of the Platonic dialogues3
and the commentary on the text will give proof of various reminiscences
which he utilized for the ‘ setting' of the piece, as well as for the manage-
ment of its development. For example, the Dialogue professes to be only a
narrative of a conversation in which certain distinguished persons had once
taken part, thus reproducing the frame-work of the De Oratore 1. Tacitus
himself was present only as a listener, like Cicero in the De Amicitia and
De Natura Deorum. The device of marking the transition from the first
to the second part of the dialogue by the introduction of a fresh speaker
(ch. 14) seems to be borrowed from the De Oratore ii. § 14: cp. De Rep.
i. ξ 17 ². The promise in the last chapter of a continuation of the debate
at some future time is a feature which Cicero had originally taken from
Plato (see De Orat. i. ad fin. ; De Nat. Deor. iii. ξ 94). Other resemblances
are noticed in connexion with postero die, 2. 1 and Pro duobus promitto,
16. 8. References are made to Cicero's letters (18. 22 sqq.) and speeches ³,
his lost dialogue Hortensius (16. 28) and also to his poems (21. 29). Aper
