and Head Master of Merchant Taylors from 1686 till he was dismissed
in 1691 for not having taken the oath of allegiance ¹. vThe MS. was
bought along with six otherS, for the sum of ἐγ 7s., from W. Bowyer,
the printer, who acted as Bonwicke's executor after his death on Oct. 20,
1722. The date of the transaction is recorded as Sept. 11, 1725 ².

The Harleianus (H) is mentioned by Roth in his edition of Suetonius
(p. lxi), and Michaelis derived his account of it from him. Baehrens also
refers to it in his critical commentary, but only to deny it any authority.
He ranks it after the Parisienszk 7773 and the Vz‘ndobononszlv (νῖ), and
describes all three as ‘ of very recent date and vilely interpolated'—libri
quidam recentzlrsimi foedissimeque interpolati (p. 4 5). Ι shall be able to
show, however, that the Harleianus takes us back to within a few years of
Enoch’s discovery, and that the Parzlvienszlv, which was used by Pithon and
included by Michaelis among the MSS. on which he founded his critical
edition (1868), was directly copied from it at a date considerably later.
The Parisiensis need not be referred to again in any discussion of the
text of the Dialogue. It has not, and ought never to have been allowed,
any independent value whatever. Perhaps the clearest proof that it is*
a mere copy of H may be found in the fact that at 40. 9 it omits the
words [libertatem vocabant comes seditionum effrenati] These words form
a single line in H, and were inadvertently passed over by the copyist.
The late date of th‘e Parisienszis is indicated by what Pithou says in his
Paris edition (1580): in huius autem dialogi editione, praeter exemplar in
Italia ante aliquot annos descriptum, maximo nobis adiumento suit Lipsiz·
nostri industria, &c. In his commentary on 15. 2 he reports a marginal
note Eadem verba sunt Petroni: ⁴ in exemplari Italico ad h. l. adscriptum
fuit Eadem verba sunt Petroni et sane quaedam initio Satyrici Petroniani
quae huius disputationis aliquot locis valde consentanea sunt! This
enabled Egger³ to identify the Parisiensis as the codex used by Pithon,
and thus to solve a question to which he alludes as ‘lis a viris doctis
agitata': he found traces of the words eadem verba sunt Petronii in the
