DIALOGUS DE ORATORIBUS. 7

et adgnosces quae audisti.

Quod si qua omisit Cato, sequenti ω

recitatione Thyestes dicet3 hanc enim tragoediam disposui

iam et intra me ipse formavi.

Atque ideo maturare libri huius

editionem festino, ut dimissa priore cura novae cogitationi toto

pectore incumbam.’

omissis orationum et causarum studiis omne tempus modo circa
Medeam, ecce nunc circa Thyestem consumaS, curn te tot ami-

5. 1), will appreciate my attitude. I
have made no changes. More than that :
“ Thyestes ’' will supplement “ Cat0.’' ’-—1t
is impossible to explain the indirect clause
grammatically‚withoutresorting to the easy
change from leges to intelleges (cp. Quint.
x. 3, 20): leges can hardly be construed
as=legend0 cognosces (as Halm, John).
The pf. debuerit is quite appropriate:
‘ what I considered my bounden duty!

11·. hanc enim, ‘ that is the name
of the tragedy which I have shaped in
outline and planned in my head.' Maternus
is here giving his friends a piece of news :
cp. ecce nunc, below.

plerumque intra me ipse volvam: Quint.
xi. 3, 2 quae intra nosmet ipsos com-
posuimus.

maturare . .
is used here as=‘accelerate,’ ‘hurty on'
the publication os (as often in Tacitus with
‘ caedem ⁸ and other accusatives), there is
a slight pleonasm. But others take it as =
perficere, adfinem perducere. This does
not go so well, however, with editio (though
editio is coming to have a concrete sense
in Quint. v. 11, 40: xii. 10, 55).

si effectis in quae tetendi plures ad curas

Ponto, iv. 16, 39. Of a speech, 6. 23 below.

Ponto, iii. 1, 39 pectore te toto cunctisque
incumbere nervis. For the dat. after
incumbere, see Quint. xi. 3, 1.

satiant (sc. neque impediunt) quo minus,'
or ‘ satietate non deterrent quo minus,' &c. z
lit. ‘you have not, then, had so much of
tragedy as to prevent you from,' διο. For
other cases of an ellipse with quo minus

mittere quo minus iuventutem armarent:
ib. xx. 6 nihil interim apud hostes quietum
pati, quo minus subitis excursibus popu-
laretur. The analogy of the last two
passages especially shows that the text
ought to be rendered: ⁶ Then you have
not had, enough of those tragedies of
yours. Turning your back upon . . . you
spend your whole time,' &c. Somewhat
similar is Soph. Phil. 339 ἀρκεῖν . . . ὥστε

ning of the sentence, which is sometimes ex-
hibited as interrogative in form (‘ Is it so
true, then, that, &e.) ε cp. Ann. xi. 16, 17 z

as Hist. ii. 51, 23 iii. 85, 1. Ecce comes in·
naturally before nunc, as Aper has just
heard of the ‘ Thyestes' for the first time.
But otherwise there is no indication of the
sequence of the plays, though some have
thought that the context would have led
us to expect ‘ Catonem ’ in place of
‘Medeam' Aper keeps the ‘Cato’ to
the end, in order that he may set it (along-
side with the ‘Domitius') over against the
‘Graeculorum fabulae,' i. e. dramas like
the ‘ Medea’ and the ‘ Thyestes' which only
gave a new presentment of subjeets that
had been treated scores of times before.
