DIALOGUS DE ORATORIBUS. 99

Hinc leges assiduae et populare nomen, hinc contiones magis-
tratuum paene pernoctantium in rostriS, hinc accusationes po-
tentium reorum et adsignatae etiam domibus inimicitiae, hinc
procerum factiones et assidua senatus adversus plebem certamina.
Quae singula etsi distrahebant rem publicam, exercebant tamen
illorum temporum eloquentiam et magnis cumulare praemiis
videbantur, quia quanto quisque plus dicendo poterat, tanto
facilius honores adsequebatur, tanto magis in ipsis honoribus
collegas suos anteibat, tanto plus apud principes gratiae, plus
auctoritatis apud patreS, plus notitiae ac nominis apud plebem
parabat. Hi clientelis etiam exterarum nationum redundabant,
ι hos ituri in provincias magistratus reverebantur, hos reversi

general ferment, without the strong hand
of a single ruler, the measure of each
speaker's political discernment was his
power of influencing the unstable popu-
lace,' i. e. each enjoyed a reputation for
wisdom in proportion to his powers of
persuasion. Saperet must=sapere vide-
retur, sc. sibi et aliis : not, as Church and
Brodribb. ‘ exactly adapted his wisdom to
the bewildered people’s capacity of con-
viction.'—Johns explanation is rather
different : he would supply ‘ sapere ' with
‘ quantum‚' contending that there is
nothing anomalous in a speaker's reputa-
tion depending on his proved ability to
produce conviction in others, and that
the reference must be to the impression
and appearance of wisdom that his words
produce. The sense would then be ‘ That
speaker was most highly thought of who
could best dazzle and hoodwink his
audience.' In this case, erranti will best
be taken of ‘erroneous judgment' (Cic.
de Off. i. ξ 65 qui pendet ex errore im-
peritae multitudinis) rather than, as
I prefer to take it, of unstable equilibrium :
cp. 40. 19 nostra quoque civitas, donec
erravit. So Andresen, erranti = ‘inter
varia ac saepe diversa iudicia fluctuanti,
modo hunc modo illum admiranti.'

10. et populare. The conjunction is
‘ explicative ἐ tr. ‘ a constant succession
of legislative enactments and consequent
popularity.' The motive, as well as the
result, of such activity was to gain favour
as a champion of popular rights: cp. plus
. . . nominis apud plebem parabat, below.

1 1. paene pernoctantium in rostris.
So frequently in Cicero τ Brut. ξ 305
habitant in rostris: pro Mur. ξ 21 in foro
habitant: de Or. i. ξ 264 is qui habitaret
in subselliis.

accusationes . . . reorum, tauto-
logical: cp. Ann. xi. 5, 1 saevus accu-
sandis reis. So 37. 14 accedebat splendor
reorum et magnitudo causarum.

1 2. adsignatae = attributae, ‘ attaching
to ’ : tr. ‘ in which whole samilies became
involved,' or ‘ which became hereditary in
whole families’ (Germ. xxi. 1). For
parallel instances of adsignare in
this sense of ‘making a thing one's own,'
John cites Quint. iv. 6, 62; xii. 10, 41;
ix. 4, 29.

13. procerum factiones, ‘ schisms in
the party of the aristocracy‚’—some of the
‘ nobiles ’ taking up the cause of the
peo le.

115). cumulare. So Verg. Aen. v. 5 32
Acesten muneribus cumulat magnis: cp.
Hist. ii. 57, 9; iii. 36, 13.

18. anteibat : Hist. iii. 65, 5.

principes, ‘ the leading men?

19. notitiae ac nominis, as at 11. 1 1.
For notitia, cp. on 5. 19.

20. clientelis . . . redundabant.
There may be a reference, with the view of
glorifying the eloquence of former days,
to the words which Aper had used (3. ad
fin.) in addressing Maternus: cum te tot
. . . coloniarum et municipiorum clientelae
in forum vocent. Tr. ‘These were the
men whose protection was eagerly sought
after even by whole nations of foreigners' a
