30 CORNELII ΤΑ CI TI

famam Euripidis aut Sophoclis quam Lysiae aut Hyperidis

includi.

Plures hodie reperies qui Ciceronis gloriam quam qui

Vergilii detrectent, nec ullus Asinii aut Messallae liber tam
2 5 inlustris est quam Medea Ovidii aut Varii ThyesteS.

13. Ac ne fortunam quidem vatum et illud felix contubernium·
comparare timuerim cum inquieta et anxia oratorum vita. Licet
illos certamina et pericula sua ad consulatus evexerint, malo
securum et quietum Vergilii secessum, in quo tamen neque apud
divum Augustum gratia caruit neque apud populum Romanurn

13. 3. ad LipsiuS, et codd. consulatus C, conventus D, cent ' A, coetus Β.

22. Euripidis aut Sophoclis. In a
comparison with Lysias and Hyperides,
Euripides naturally comes first: magis
accedit oratorio generi, Quint. x. 1, 68,
where see note.

23. Ciceronis. For Cicero's detrac-
tors, see on chap. 18. That Vergil, too,
was not without his critics‚ is clear from
the Life of Donatus, ch. 43: cp. Suet.
Calig. 34

24. liber here of course (as at 38. 14,
where see note) of a speech, written down
and published. Asinius Pollio (75 Β. C.-
4 A.D.) and M. Valerius Messalla Cor-
vinus (64 B.C.—8 A.D.) are criticised to·
gether as orators by Quintilian x. 1, 113,
where see notes. Other references to
them occur in chs. 17, 18, and 21.

2 5. Medea . . . Thyestes. The con-
junction of these two tragedies by Quin-
tilian is also noteworthy: iam Vari
Thyestes cuilibet Graecarum comparari
potest. Ovidi Medea videtur mihi osten-
dere quantum ille vir praestare potuen't
si ingenio suo imperare quam indulgere
maluisset, x. 1, 98. L. Varius Rufus
had gained a high reputation as an epie
poet, before he took to tragedy : cp Hor.
Car. i. 6 Scriberis Vario . . . Maeonii
carminis alite: Ep. ii. 1, 246: A. P. 55.
He is known also as the friend of Vergil
and Horace (Sat. i. 5, 40: 6, 55), and
helped to edit the Aeneid aster Vergil’s
death.

13. 1. illud felix contubernium.
Cp. assiduitate contubernii, 5. 5, with
note: Sen. Dial. vi. 10, 4 iam disicietur
iste comitatus, iam contubernia ista sub-
lato clamore solventur. The allusion is
to the retired life of the poet (cp. securum
et quietum . . . secessum, below), with
its exclusive but delightful companion-

ships, ‘ far from the madding crowd‘s
ignoble strise: in contrast to the busy
bustling life of the advocate, as described
e. g. at 6. 3. It is not necessary how·
to take the words as a refutation of what
Aper had said at the end of ch. 9 z Mater-
nus knows and values the pleasures of
solitude, 17 below.

3. certamina. et pericula is taken
by all the commentators as a hendiadys.
for certamina periculosa. Is is not pos-
sible, however, that while pericula has
here its usual meaning of ‘ actions at law,'
certamina may refer to less formal com-
bats, such as those in the senate? Cp. 5.
32 eius modi certaminum rudem: also,
et causis et iudiciis 34. 15. Pericula
are contrasted with ‘ privatae causae ' in
Quint. vi. 1, 36. ·

ad consulatus evexerint. For the
expression, cp. Hist. ii. 7 5, 8 e gregario ad
summa militiae provectum: Vell. Pat. ii.
90, 1 quem usque in tertium consulatum
. . . amicitia principis evexerat. Evelzo
in this sense is poetical: Hor. Car. i. 1,
5; Verg. Aen. vi. 130. Gudeman, who
would read vel ad, rightly argues that an
‘enumeration of some of the positions
which an orator might hope to attain
through his eloquence decidedly weakens
the force of the passage,' and therefore
rejects ‘ ad opes et’ (Ritter), ‘ ad sacerdotia,
vel praeturas et ' (Vahlen). On the otherv
hand vel (written t.) may account for the
confusion in the MSS. See Introd. p. lxxx.

4. securum et quietum. So quietis
et securitatis, 10. 35. ,

Vergilii secessum. In the last years
of his life Vergil had a country-house at
what is now called Posilippo, to the
west of Naples. For secessum, cp. Quint.
x. 3, 28 ‘ silentium et secessum?
