DIALOGUS DE ORA TORIBUS. 53

Verrem libros exspectabit? Quis de exceptione et formula per-
petietur illa immensa volumina quae pro M. Tullio aut Aulo
Caecina legimus? Praecurrit hoc tempore iudex dicentem, et 5
nisi aut cursu argumentorum aut colore sententiarum aut nitore
et cultu descriptionum invitatus et corruptus est, aversatur.

3. exspectabit, &c.‚ ‘ sit patiently
through.' The idea is that of being ‘ kept
waiting,' and unable to get away till the
speaker is done: Hor. Sat. i. 5, 9 cenantes

exceptione et formula, ‘ equitable
pleas and forms of procedure.’ Under
the ‘formulary system,’ the praetor (in
iure) first heard parties, and then prepared
a formula which was sent down to the
iudex who had to try the case (in
iudicio). This formula determined the
nature of the question which had to be
decided, and consisted of three parts t (1)
the demonstratio, or statement of the
facts, (2) the intentio, or plaintifl's claim,
with the question for the decision of the
iudex in the light of all the circumstances,
and (3) the condemnatio or adiudicatio,
giving the iudex or arbiter power to
aequit and condemn, or to adjudicate.
It was to the second of these that the
Exceptio, or equitable plea on the part of
the defendant, was usually tacked on, and
it was the duty of the defendant‘s counsel
to see that all such pleas were properly
entered before the praetor in iure, as
otherwise the iudex in iudicio would be
unable to recognise them. A counter-
claim against the pursuer in an action for
debt-recovery is perhaps the most obvious
form of exceptio. .

4. pro Μ. Tullio. Cicero defended
him in two speeches (B.C. 72 or 71), the
second of which exists in a fragmentary
condition. The action seems to have
concemed a piece of landed property, of
which the adversary of Tullius had taken
forcible possession.

Aulo Caecina. This speech, which
was delivered Β. c. 69 or 68, turned on
questions which Aper says it would be
diffieult to make interesting now. Cp.
Cic. Or. § 102 Tota mihi causa pro
Caecina de verbis interdicti fuit: res invo-

lutas definiendo explicavimus, ius civile
laudavimus, verba ambigua distinximus.
See Sandys’ notes ad loc., from which it
will appear that Cicero had good ground
for asking for the indulgence of those who
listened to his pleading: pro Caec. ch. x.
‘ si sorte videbor altius initium rei demon-
strandae petiisse quam me ratio iuris . . .
coegerit, quaeso ut ignoscatis‚’ διο.

6. eursu argumentorum, the ‘ rapid
march of the proof.’ Cp. Quint. ix, 4, 138
in prooemiis plerumque submissi . . . in
argumentis citati atque ipso etiam motu
celeres sumus: Cic. Or. § 212 cursum
contentiones magis requirunt.

colore sententiarum, ‘ piquancy of
utterance’ : cp. ‘ arguta et brevi sententia,'
below, Color = ‘ tone,’ ‘ complexion‚’
with reference to an artificial and rheto-
rical style of composition. Similarly it
is used, in the concrete, of a happy
thought, or sudden inspiration, ‘extem-
poralis color,' Quint. x. 6, 5.

nitore et cultu, as 23. 21 ε Tr. ‘ gloss
and polish.' Cp. Quint. x. 1, 124 Scripsit
. . . non sine cultu ac nitore: xi. 1, 48
illud iam diximus quanto plus nitoris et
cultus demonstrativae materiae . . . quam
suasoriae iudicialesque permittant. Nitor
and its cognates, when used of oratio, are
constantly opposed to such words as
horridus, squalidus, sordidus. For cultus
Cicero used ornatus : the word recurs at
line 17, below: 26. 6: Ann. xiii. 3, 7.

7. descriptionum. Cp. Cic. Top. 5 83
Descriptio, quam χαρακτῆρα Graeci vo-
cant . . . qualis sit avarus, qualis assen-
tator, ceteraque eiusdem generis, in quibus
natura et vita describitur. The word is not
confined to descriptions of places.

invitatus et corruptus, ‘ captivated
and demoralized.’ So Cic. Sen. ξ 57 invitat
atque adlectat senectus. For invitare in
the sense of to ‘ win over‚' cp. Hist. ii. 82
ad fin„ praeceptumque ut praetorianos
Vitellio infensos reciperandae militiae
praemio invitarent. Literally, invitare is
