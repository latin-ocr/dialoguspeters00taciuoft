proved his best safeguard, and he has no misgivings for the future:
statum hucusque ac securitatem melius innocentia tueor quam eloquentia,
nec vereor ne mihi unquam verba in senatu nisi pro alterius discrimine
fluenda sint, ch. 11 ad fin. His closing speech shows that he was not
one of those impracticable philosophers against whom even the patient
Vespasian had to act with vigour ¹. Like Tacitus, he had his regrets for
the past, but he did not rebel against the present. He recognizes, with
Messalla, the superiority of the eloquence of the ‘ antiqui ' (27. 3), but he
tempers Messalla's rather one-sided exaltation of the oratory of repub—
lican times by dwelling on the regrettable conditions on which it had
thriven. His whole attitude is one of reconciliation. He can venture
to be severe on persons of such doubtful antecedents as Crispus and
Marcellus (13. 11), and he claims for himself the same freedom of speech
as he would allow to others (27. 12): but he is sensible also of the
advantages which settled order and good government have secured for
the state (38 ad fin.), even though the introduction of the new
regime had not at once involved the downfall of those who, like Crispus
and Marcellus, had made themselves indispensable to former and more
unworthy rulers. His frequent references to the contracted sphere in
which oratory was now confined are made as an additional justification
of his personal attitude. He is forsaking a profession which had become
irksome to him ² (remotum . . . necessitate cotidie aliquid contra animum
faciendi, 13. 17), and which can no longer be what it was once: minor
oratorum honor obscuriorque gloria inter bonos mores et in obsequium
regentis paratos, 41. 11. There is no irony in all this, as some critics
have supposed. The attitude of Maternus towards imperialism must
have been common in the cultured society of the day. It was that of
Tacitus himself ⁸. The chief person of the Dialogue gives utterance to

he was about thirty years of age. It is
not improbable, however, that in this
presentation of Maternus the author gave
expression to what were really his own
thoughts and aspirations on this subject,
though he may not have carried them
into effect at once. He was no doubt

¹ Their banishment from Rome in the

Dialogue is represented as having taken
place, suggests the possibility that any
danger anticipated sor Maternus may
have been due to a sort of nervous
apprehension of the extent to which the

emperor might carry his measures of
retaliation. But Maternus did not sym-
pathize with the · intransigeant’ party,
any more than Tacitus himself.

It is not necessary to discover in this
fact a proof that Tacitus's object in
writing the Dialogue was to justisy his
own retirement from the profession of the
bar. We do not know, as a matter of
fact, that he retired at the time of the
composition of the treatise‚ i. e. when

conscious, in spite of his great success as
a pleader‚ that forensic oratory could
never be again what it had been, and he
must therefore have been in thorough
sympathy with Maternus’s statement of
the reasons which had induced him to
take the resolution referred to.
