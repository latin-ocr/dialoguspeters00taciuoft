THE QUESTION OF AUTHORSHIP ΛΝΒ DA TE. xiii

from July 1, 74, to July 1, 75. According to this calculation, the con-
versation recorded in the Dialogue must have taken place in that year: if
on the very anniversary of Cicero’s death (in hunc diem), on December 7,
Aa). 74. But this gives, strictly speaking, only 116 years as the interval
which has elapsed since the death of Cicero, not 120 years as stated in
the text. Again‚ in enumerating the reigns of which the sum total is
composed, the manuscripts give 59 for Augustus, 23 for Tiberius, 4 for
Caligula, 28 for Claudius and Nero, 1 for Galba, Otho, and Vitellius, and
6 for Vespasian: a total of 121 years. This last discrepancy need not
be considered of much weight, especially in view of the approximate
character of some of the constituent factors‚ as, for example, prope
quadriennium Gai: it is sufficiently accurate for the speaker's purpose.
A more serious difficulty consists in the ascription of 59 years to
Augustus, when as a matter of fact he ought to be credited with only
56 (A. U. c. 711-767). Some have proposed to leave this standing, as
an error of the writer or the speaker (cp. 34 ad fin„ where we have nono
decimo for uno et vicesimo) ; but it is hardly likely that a figure doubtless
so well-known would have been incorrectly given. Lipsius therefore
changed novem to sex, and all editors follow his lead. But this gives only
118 years as the total, a consideration which has led to the obvious sug-
gestion that centum et duodevigenti should be substituted in the text for

‘³ , centum et viginti. It is usually considered more probable, however,

 

(especially in view of the repetition of the figure at the end of ch. 24),
that centum et vzgrinti is given as a round number, summing up in a
general way the duration of the constituent principates as stated in what
goes before. In any case, it is impossible to make centum et viginti
square exactly with sexta statio in the sense of the sixth year of
Vespasian's reign. ¹

The numbers have in all probability been tampered with by some
reader who was anxious to correct the speaker's arithmetic z this is almost
certainly the origin of the unhistorical novem et quinquaginta for the
duration of the reign of Augustus. If we suppose that Aper dated Ves-
pasian's reign from the time of his arrival in Rome, in the middle of the
year 70, instead of from July 1, 69, we must follow most editors in
fixing on ΑΛ). 75 as the year in which the dialogue was held. This
would give, on the inclusive method of reckoning, 1 18 years as the exact in-
terval (43 -}- 75) : a figure with which the detailed enumeration corresponds,
if we adopt Lipsius's emendation Statue sex et quinquaginta annos.
On this explanation also centum et vzgrmtz· must be either a round number
or a mistake for centum et duodeviginti. Something might be said in
favour of the year A.D. 76, if we were to make three emendations on the
