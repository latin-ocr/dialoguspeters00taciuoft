 

SUBSTANCE AND SCHEME OF THE DIALOGUE. xxiii

treatise will reveal the difficulties which attach to this, and, indeed, to
any other theory.

It is important to note that, though it is not directly treated till the
beginning of the third part, the real subject of the Dialogue is clearly
and distinctly stated in the very opening sentence. It is the decadenee
and dethronement of eloquence. The causes of this phenomenon
had formed the theme of frequent discussion between the writer and
his friend, Justus Fabius: saepe ex me requiris, Iuste Fabi, cur, cum priora
saecula tot eminentium oratorum ingeniis gloriaque floruerint, nostra polis-
simum aetas deserta et laude eloquentiae orbata vix nomen zjosum oratoris
retineat. The writer is conscious of the greatness of the subject, and of
his own inability to do justice to it3 but he professes to be in a position
to deal with it by simply rehearsing, exactly as it occurred, a conversation
to which he had been privileged to listen when a very young man. He
was then a student at the bar, and had attached himself, as was the
manner of such students, to two of the most famous pleaders of the day,
Marcus Aper and Julius Secundus. In company with them, he went to
call on the poet-pleader, Curiatius Maternus, whose recitation of his
tragedy Calo on the previous day, and his avowed preference of poetry
over oratory, form the subject of some introductory dialogue. Referring
to the offence that was alleged to have been taken at some of the senti-
ments expressed in the Cat0, Secundus asks Maternus if he intends to
revise and alter his drama in any way3 to which Maternus replies, in
the most outspoken manner, that it will be published exactly as it was
read, and that he has on hand another tragedy, the Thyestes, which
will follow his Cato and supply any omissions. On this Aper makes
a somewhat angry protest against what he considers the wrong-headed-
ness of Maternus in dissipating his energies on such productioris, when
he might have his hands full of forensic work. Maternus replies
that their frequent differences in regard to this matter rather take the
edge off Aper’s attack, but offers to leave it in the hands of Secundus,
who will either forbid him to write poetry, or else, as he himself would
prefer, use his influence to constrain him to leave the narrow groove of
professional work at the bar and give himself wholly over to the com-
panionship of the Muses. He appeals to Secundus as one on whose
sympathies he can depend (3. 9); and Secundus confesses to a certain bias
by the reference which he makes to his intimate friendship with the poet
Saleius Bassus. Aper, however, retorts that it is quite different with those
who are poets and nothing else, and proceeds to impeach Maternus for
his neglect of the art of oratory,

Aper's speech consists of a eulogy of oratoria eloquentia in respect of its
