 

THE QUESTJON off A UTHORSHIP ΛΝΒ DA TE. vii

nence to Gutmann's argument, Orelli himself declared his preference for
the tradition of the Tacitean authorship. To him the Dialogue was
a work of the historian's youth, written while he was still under the
influence of the associations of the schools of rhetoric, and before he had
passed from the stage of enthusiastic adherence to Cicer0‚ as the perfect
model of Latin eloquence‚ to the development of the highly individual
style which characterizes the Histories‚ and still more the Annals.
The absurdity involved in applying the same standard of criticism to
a dramatic dialogue and a narrative of events he protests against in the
following words: Aliam orationem exigit narratio rerum, aliam discep-
tatio quaestionis alicuius. Boni scriptoris est utrumque genus intellectu
distinguere, alterutro uti, excellentis vero parem esse in utriusque orationis
facultate. Atqui ego Tacitum excellentem dicendi artificem existimo, tam vi
naturae quam arte doctrinaque. Quid mirum igitur si in dissimillimo
genere dicendi sibi ipsi dissimillimus suit ,Ρ

If the current of opinion since Orelli’s day had set in the same
direction, the history of the controversy might now be considered closed.
But though scholars like Doederlein and Niebuhr sided with the vindicators
of Tacitus, nothing better than an open verdict was arrived at by Eckstein,
when he undertook to review all the conditions of the problem as well as
the opinions which had previously been pronounced on either side ².
While fully appreciating the force of the various arguments which had
been adduced in favour of Tacitus, and without attempting to disprove
the tradition of his authorship on any such grounds as inferiority of
subject matter or discrepancy of dates, Eckstein concluded that the
disparity of style was so great (ob difficultatem in dicendi genere a Taciti
plane abhorrente positam) that more light must be waited for before any
final deliverance could be arrived at 2. For a time negative criticism was
again in the ascendant. Eckstein was followed by H. C. A. Eichstadt ³,
whose views may be found summarized in Orelli’s second edition
(1848), vol. ii, p. 523. He believed that the treatise was composed
during the reign of Domitian (though it may not have seen the
‘light till the time of Nerva or Trajan) by one who was well read in
contemporary literature, as well as in the works of Cicero. In general,
the style is held to resemble that of Quintilian, though it is admitted that
Spalding had effectually disposed of the theory that Quintilian was the
