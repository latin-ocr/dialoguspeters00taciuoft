de viris illustribuS, and (a) the Agricola, (b) the Dialogue, and (c) the
Germania, ὅτε. ·

The ottobonianus (E) is a late codex (fifteenth or sixteenth century)
with very miscellaneous contents. After IlIessalae Corvini de progenie sua
libellus comes (a) the Suetonius fragment, and (b) the Dialogue, followed
‘by many tractateS, too various to mention. The importance of this
codex was first recognized by MichaeliS, but it was taken for a copy of
the Farnesianus (C) corrected from A. This theory was disproved by
Steuding¹‚ who erred, however, in attributing CE and Δ to a common
source.

Next to E may be placed the Vindobonenszs Dccxr (Va), whose kinship
with the Ottobonz'anus has been clearly demonstrated by Scheuer, and
whose contents are equally miscellaneous. At the close of the series
comes (a) the Germania, followed by (b) the Dialogue‚ and (c) the
Suetonius. This codex bears date A.D. 1466. It has been designated V2
to distinguish it from another Vienna manuscript, viz.—

Vindobonensis cccrr (V). This codex bears the arms of Matthias
Corvinus, King of Hungary, sor whom it was probably written. It after-
wards belonged to Joannes Sambucus (1563). It contains the last six
books of the Annals, the Hz'storz'es‚ and (a) the Germania, (b) the
Dialogue‚ where the addition to the title, in a later hand, of the name
of Quintilian helped to forward the theory that the Dialogus was really
the composition of the great teacher of rhetorio For the historical
books, it is in close agreement with the codex from which Spira must
have printed his editio princeos: see Wissowa‚ Lectiones Tacitinae‚ Speci-
men Tertium, 1832. So far as the Dialogue is concerned, it was
probably copied, carelessly enough, from a codex closely related to the
Harleianus (H), the account of which may be postponed to p. lxxv ².

The divergence between the two families will be made evident by a

consideration of the following places :—

AB
22. 4 oratores aetatis eiusdem
22. 7 iam senior

¹ Beitr'age zur Textkritik im Dialog
des Tacitus, 1878.

² While H and V belong obviously to
the same class of MSS„ any theory that
either was copied from the other is nega-
tived by the occurrence of striking and
characteristic differences‚ some of which
will be recorded below. They agree in
omitting the words [ex his suasoriae . . .
controversiae] at 35. 13-15‚ and also [ergo
non] at the commencement of ch. 37.

C DEV2AVH
eiusdem aetatis oratores
semor tam

But at 19 ad fin. V has et festinare se
testantur, while these words do not occur
in H, as also et audiantur 35. 11. On
the other hand there are no blank pages
left in V, as in H, at the end of ch. 35:
and such a variant as occurs at 19.. 5
(iud'o H sor iudicio, video V) is enough
to show that H was not copied from V ε
cp. 36. 1 omisisse H, omisso V; 31. 16
incitetur H, conciteturV; 16. 36, 32 df?
coegerunt H, dicere cogerentur V.
