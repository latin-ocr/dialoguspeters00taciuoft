'i' SUBSTANCE AND SCHEME' OF THE DIALOG'UE. xxvii

moris antiqui. In former dayS‚ he sayS, children were brought up by their

⁴ 'own motherS, who exercised a watchful care that was afterwards fruitful

 

in results: suus cuique filius . . . non in cella emptae nutricis, sed in gremio
ac sinu matris educabatur, cuius praecipua laus erat tueri domum et inservire
liberis. But now they are handed over to Greek nurses and pedagogues,
whose worthless characters are speedily reflected in the minds of their
charges. Moral- supervision on the part of parents is a thing of the
past: indeed their influence is rather the other way. Next Messalla
complains that a narrow training in rhetoric has been substituted for
that wide philosophical culture which was the strength of the speakers of
bye-gone dayS. Seeing that the orator is one who must be able to
speak fitly and persuasively on any and every topic, he ought to receive
the broadest possible education, including law and history, philosophy
and science. The neglect of what made Cicero great is, in Messalla's
judgment, the first and foremost reason of the decay of eloquence: ergo
hanc primam et praecipicam causam arbitror cur in tantum ab eloquentia
antiquorum oratorum recesserimus. There are others, but these he will
leave his friends to explain. MaternuS, however (ch. 33), suggests that the
contrast he has laid down between the ignorant apathy of his own day
and the enthusiastic and fruitful application of the ancients (dffrentzam
nostrae desidiae et inscitiae adversus acerrima et secundissima eorum studia)
ought to be followed up by a eomparison of the practical exercises (exerci-
tationes) formerly engaged in by aspirants to oratorical fame with those to
which they are confined and limited now. What should be the character
of the training which is meant to serve as a practical preparation for the
exercise of the barrister’s profession? This leads Messalla to paint a
vivid picture (34) of the Roman youth of former days, who after the most
careful home-training, and instruction in all the branches of a liberal
education (imbutus—iam domestica disciplina, refertus honestis studiis) was
introduced by his father or some other relative to one of the most
eminent orators and statesmen of the day, under whose immediate
auspices he speedily acquired familiarity with the actual practice of his
profession. He learned his craft under a master’s eye, studying it, not in
any eloistered retreat, but in the open light of day, and face to face with
critical situations (in media luce atque inter ipsa discrimina). It was on
the battle-field, in fact, that he received lessons in the art of war (pugnare
in proelio discebat). What a contrast between the great opportunities
thus afforded of drinking at the well of eloquence pure and undefiled‚
gauging the* popular taste, and gaining experience of real issues,—-and
the narrowing influences of the school of rhetoric, with its unedi·
'fying companionship‚ its artificial methodS‚ its stock subjects for empty
