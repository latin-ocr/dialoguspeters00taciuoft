reading of the MSS.: (1) sex et quinquaginta, with Lipsius ; (2) sep-
timam . . . stationem, with Ulrichs; and (3) centum et undevtginti (cxrx
for cxx). On the whole, however, Ι prefer to hold fast to sextam
staticmem: and taking it as the one fixed and certain factor in the
calculation‚ accept the year A.D. 74—75 as the date wanted, altering the
other figures to correspond. This involves the acceptance of Lipsius's
sex et quinquaginta. If we suppose, further, that in hunc diem is to
be pressed, as indicating that the company had met on or about the
anniversary of Cicero's death, i.e. in December 74 ¹, we shall be tempted
to make an additional change from centum et viginti to centum et

sedecim (cxx-cxvr). Everything will in this way come out square, and
in accordance with the known facts of history. The constituent factors

are enumerated separately and approximately, and then Aper does the
rapid calculation, which gives exactly 116 years (A. U. c. ’χΙΙ-827) as
the correct interval between December 43 B.c. and December, A. D. 74.
In favour of the end of the year ΑΛ). 74 as the date of the meeting
made famous in the Dialogue, a certain amount of additional evidence is
derived from various allusions in the body of the treatise itself. Thus at
17. 22 reference is made to the last largess which had been given to the
people (proximo quidem congiario ipsi vidistis plerosque senes, &c.) as
something within recent memory: it is known to have been given by
Titus in 73. Again in 37. 1 Mucianus is spoken of as alive and at
work over a collection of speeches belonging to the republican period.
Now from a passage in Pliny (N. H. xxxii. 6, 62), in which he is referred
to in the past tense, it has been argued, with great probability that in
Λα). 77—the year in which Pliny presented his Natural IIistory to Titus
—Mucianus was no longer alive (see Teuffel—Schwabe, ἐξ 313-4). This
would seem at least to narrow the range of choice to one of the years
preceding that date—as an upper limit. For the lower limit, mention
may be made of the use of nuper2 at 5. 30, referring to an appearance
made by Eprius Marcellus before the senate, probably in the year Aa), 70.
Another reference to the same individual, along with Vibius Crispus,
points more definitely to the year 74 itself: nunc principes in Caesaris
amicitia agunt feruntque cuncta (8. 18). Eprius had been away in
Asia from 71 to 73, doing duty as proconsul: he was consul suffectus

all MSS. at 17. 7 in any way support this tempore,' see Gerber and Greef, p. 988.
suppositioni Aper is making Tiro his Vespasian's liberality to Saleius Bassus—
authority: but if the date of the meeting Laudavimus nuper ut miram et eximiam
was one of the days between the Nones Vespasiani liberalitatem, 9. 24—was
and the Ides, he might have said for probably of more recent date, nearer
brevity septimum idus (lios idus?)=‘ the the time of the Dialogue than the year
seventh of this mouth.' A. D. 70.
