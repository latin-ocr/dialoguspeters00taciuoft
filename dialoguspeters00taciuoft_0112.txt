hardly meet the demand, even if you had
kept to the traditional type of tragedy,—
instead of encumbering yourself, &c.

19. novum negotium. This does not
necessarily imply that Maternus had only
lately taken up such subjects: like the
‘Medea’ (ch. 9), the ‘Domitius’ was pro·
bably ene of his earlier dramas. His
historical dramas are ⁴ new’ in the sense
of being unlike the conventional models
drawn from Greek mythology‚—unlike
even the ‘ praetextatae ' of earlier poets.
(See Schoell‚ Commentationes Woelffli-
nianae, pp. 395—6). They were καιναὶ τρα-
γῳδίαι, subjects treated for the first time,
new ‘ history-plays ’ bases on scenes con-
, nected with the Fau of the Republic.

20. importasses = imposuisses, in-
iunxisses. The word occurs in Tacitus
only here : in Cicero and Livy it is com-
mon enough in such phrases as ‘incom-
modum‚ periculum, detrimentum (sibi,
aliis) importare.’ So also Pliny N. H.
xxvi. 9. Tr. ‘ if you had not burdened
yourself with a fresh task, by ’ διο.

Domitium. Probably L. Domitius
Ahenobarbus, consul Β. C. 54, and a con-
sistent opponent of Julius Caesar. He
was pardoned aster the capture of Cor-
finium, but rejoined the Pompeians, and
fell at Pharsalus. Lucan selects him for
eulogy in compliment to his descendant
Nero: Phars. vii. 599-616.-1 am not
convinced by the arguments with which
Schoell supports his proposal (Comm.
Woelff„ p. 396 sq.) to understand the
allusion to be to Cn. Domitius Aheno-
barbus (the‘ Enobarbus’ of Shakespeare' s
⁴ Antony and Cleopatra '), though his
career had greater elements of romance
in it than that of his father.

22. 8:

aggregares ABCADH‚ aggregarem E, adgregarem V2‚
Possibly adgregandi: see Introd. p. lvii.

21. adgregando. The frequent in-
stances of the misinterpretation of com·
pendia (especially terminations) in the
Dialogue, as well as Tacitus's fondness
for this construction, have led me to
insert adgregando in the text, in place of
Niebuhr's ut . . . adgregares. Cp. conce·
dendo ll.5: componendo 14. 20: docendo
83. 14 z adiciendo Ann. v. 6, ad fin. ι
other eu. in Dr. ξ 203. Cp. Introd. p. lvii.

4. 1. frequens et assidua. For other
instances of this Ciceronian amplitude,
see Introd. p. li.

2. in consuetudinem vertisset.
Cicero frequently uses venire in consuetu-
dinem : e. g. pro Caec. ξ 6 quod quoniam
iam in consuetudinem venit. For the intran-
sitive use of vertere (frequent in Tacitus)
cp. Hist. iv, 27, 6 'quod tum in morem ver·
terat: Germ. xxxi. 2 in consensum vertit.
Sall. Iug. 85. 9 bene facere iam ex consue-
tudine ln naturam vertit.

3. agitare et insequi. Cic. pro Mur.
ξ 21 agitat rem militarem, insectatur
totam hanc legationem.

4. desidiam advocationum, ‘neglect
of my professional duties.’ Such a genitive
occurs nowhere else with desidia, though
common enough with incuria, negle-
gentia, &c.

5. defendendae . . . poeticae. The
gerundive is an epexegetic genitive, show-
ing in what the patrocinium consists‚ as
solitum effugium prorumpendi, Ann. ii. 47,
3, cultus . ..venerandi‚ ib. iii. 63, 12: cp. iv.
2, 1 ο : if it had not been for the insertion of

‘defi adversus te' the words ‘ hoc patroci—
nium poeticae ’ might have stood by them·
selves. See Roby, Pres. lxvii, where
‘ oratores pacis ’ and ‘ oratores pacis peten-
dae ' are shown to be equivalent z cp. also
Cic. in Verr. ii. 4. 113 propter eam causam
sceleris istius. The use of the legal
