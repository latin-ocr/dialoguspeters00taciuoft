26. 23 velut EV2CAH (and corr. B) vult AB

26. 24 incusato EV2CA in Curato A, incurate BD,
in curato H

29. 12 invenies EV2CADH invenires AB

35. 16 perfidem EV2CAD perfidie ABH

Probability is strongly in favour also of :—

24. 12 in tantum EV2CAH as against tantum AB

37. 19 habendus EV2CA „ habendus est ABH (est habendus D)
41. 9 tamen EV2CADH ,‚ inde AB

Here are two cases of transposition, in regard to which the superiority
of the Y reading is argued in the notes :—

EV2CADH AB
22. 4 eiusdem aetatis oratores oratores eiusdem aetatis
22. 7 senior iam ¹ iam senior
Cp. also 30. 20 ingenuae artis artis ingenuae

It is probably the superior knowledge of the copyist that is de-
monstrated in :—

23. 1 ius verrinum EV2CADH as against ius vetm'num AB

5. 6 Saleium V2CADH, Selez‘um E „ Salerum A, galeria B
9. 9 Saleium EV2CAH, Saltium D ‚, Caelez‘um A, Coeleium B

When we corne to examine the places where the correct reading seems
to have depended on the copyist's ability to interpret compendia and
terminal abbreviationS‚ we find a very considerable advantage on the
side of the Y family. It should be remembered‚ however, that this is
in itself no proof of the superiority of Y over X. The following is a list
of the readings which are rightly given by the descendants of Y :—

⁰ 2. 14 omni EV2CA cu ABDH

5. 15 necessitudznes EV2CAD necessitates AB (nationes H, edd. vett.)

5. 25 peffugz‘o EV2CAD profugio AB (praesidio H, edd. vett.)

6. 18 quemcunque C, quencun- quandocunque AB (quacunque H, and
que E, quemconque D, b in marg.)
quecuq V2

7. 15 nomina EV2CADH no' AB

9. 10 eius EV2CAD (om. H) est AB

9. 21 praecepta EV2AD percepta ABC H

¹ Gudeman supports the reading of the to combine with et, ac, ut, non, nisi, si,
Y class here by pointing out that ‘ omit· que, and the like’ the postpositive use os
ting such stereotype collocations as iam iam is the general rule in the Dialogue.
vero, iam pridem, iam dudum, and Such instances, however, as 32. 3o; 7. 173
observing that iam has a decided tendency 8. 17 3 32. 305 89. 6, are not to the point.
