DIALOGUS DE ΘΚΑ TORIBUS. 31

notitia. Testes Augusti epistulae, testis ipse populuS, qui auditis
in theatro Vergilii versibus surrexit universus et forte praesentem
spectantemque Vergilium veneratus est sic quasi Augustum. Ne
nostris quidem temporibus Secundus Pomponius Afro Domitio

vel dignitate vitae vel perpetuitate famae cesserit.

iste et Marcellu5‚.ad quorum exempla me vocas, quid habent

8. [Vergilium] Ernesti.

6. Augusti epistulae. Samples have
come down to us in Donatus's Life of
Vergil, ch. 31, and Macrob. i. 24, 11 τ
cp. Claudian, Epp. 3, 23. See A.
Weichert's Imp. Caesaris Augusti scrip-
torum reliquiae, i. p. 159.

7. versibus. The reference to the
poet’s accidental presence at the perform·
ance makes it probable that some lines
from one of his well—known works had
chanced to be quoted in the course of a·
dramatic representation. Otherwise we
know from Donatus (Life, ch. 26) and
from Servius (on Ecl. vi. 1 1) that Vergil’s
Eclogues, particularly the Sixth‚ were
often rendered on the stage, probably as
interludes: is this is what is meant here,
sorte may refer to the fact that the poet
was not usually resident in Rome.

8. spectantem defines praesentem
more nearly: Vergil was present as a
spectator. For the repetition of the
name, which is omitted by some editors,
cp. Hist. ii. 101, 5 ne ab aliis apud V itel-
lium anteirentur, pervertisse ipsum Vitel-
lium videntur: Ann. xii. 64, 10 perdita
prius Domitia Lepida, muliebribus causis,
quia Lepida, διο.

sic quasi, ‘just as if he had been
Augustus himself:' cp. Cic. ad Fam. ix.
16, 2 ut quasi aurum igni, sic benevolentia
. . . possit. This act of homage was re-
garded by the emperor as his own pecu-
liar right: cp. what Suetonius tells us
about Augustus’s displeasure when it was
rendered to his adopted sons: Eisdem
praetextatis adhuc assurectum ab universis
in theatro et a stantibus plausum gravis-
sime questus est, Aug. ch. lvi; Plin.
Panegyr. liv. 2.

- 9. Pomponius Secundus (for the in-
version in the text see on ch. 1) was consul
suffectus in Α. D. 44„ and defeated the Chatti
as legatus in Upper Germany in 50. For
this success he obtained from Claudius
the ‘ ornamenta triumphalia‚' but Tacitus
tells us that this was not his greatest title
to fame: modica pars famae eius apud

posteros, in quis carminum gloria praecel-
lit, Ann. xii. 28 ad fin. Quintilian says of
him (x. 1, 98) ε eorum (tragicorum) quos
viderim longe princeps Pomponius Secun-
dus, quem senes quidem parum tragicum
putabant, eruditione ac nitore praestare
confitebantur. The fact that he was a
man of affairs as well as a poet is often
alluded to ε cp. Plin. vii. ξ 80 in Pomponio
consulari poeta: xiii. ξ 83 apud P. S„
vatem civemque clarissimum. His friend,
Pliny the Elder, wrote his life in two*
books: see Plin. Ep. iii. 5.

Afro Domitio. The same inversion
occurs in Quint. x, 1, 86. In ξ 118 Quin-
tilian ranks him, along with Iulius Afri-
canus, far above all contemporary orators ε
eorum quos viderim Domitius Afer et
Iulius Africanus longe praestantissimi.
Afer was a native of Nismes‚ and first
acquired repute by the prosecution of
Agrippina’s cousin Claudia Pulchra : Ti-
berius declared that he was a ‘ born orator ’
(suo iure disertum, Ann. iv. 52, 18). He
was Quintilian's teacher and model: v,
7, 7 ε ΡΙίη. Ep. ii. 14.
- 10. dignitate vitae. Tacitus tells us
in the Annals (l. c.) that he was unscru-
pulous, ‘modicus dignationis et quoquo
facinore properus elarescere.' He placed
his rhetorical ability at the disposal of the
government: mox capessendis accusa-
tionibus aut reos tutando prosperiore
eloquentiae quam morum fama fuit, ibid.

perpetuitate famae. Quintilian tells
us that Afer would have best consulted
his reputation if he had retired earlier
from the practice of his profession (xii.
11, 3) : cp. Tac. l. c. aetas extrema mul-
tum etiam eloquentiae dempsit dum sessa
mente retinet silentii impatientiam.

cesserit. For a similar use os the
perfect subjunctive, cp. Quint. Χ. 1, 101
at non historia cesserit Graecis.

Crispus iste et Marcellus: see onv

vatum, annalium ad testimonia vocentur.
