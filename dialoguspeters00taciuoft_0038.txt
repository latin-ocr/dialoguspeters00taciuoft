xxvi IN TR ODUC TI ON.

compositions of former dayS, with their intricate arrangement and
technical 'divisions—the ‘book-speeches' made to order according to ·
the precepts of Hermagoras and Apollodorus—must give place to the
animation and refinement (laetitiam et pulchritudinem orationis) that have
now become indispensable: novis et exquisitis eloquentiae itineribus opus
est per quae orator fastidium aurium effugiat. Finishing with a short
review of the antiqui (21-23), Aper contends that the Ciceronian
age is really overrated: Calvus, Caelius, Caesar, Brutus, Asinius Pollio,
Messalla, Corvinus, and Cicero himself, are weighed in the balance and
found wanting. In one case the diction is slovenly (sordes verborum),
and the rhythm defective (hians compositio) : in others there is a want of
the ‘buoyancy and polish’ that mark present-day eloquence (laetitiam
nitoremque nostrorum temporum). When those who confine their ad-
miration to the past praise its speakers for their ‘ sound, pure style,’
they only confess that these speakers were wanting in vigour: parum est
aegrum non esse, fortem et laetum el alacrem volo .· prope abest ab infirmitate
in quo sola sanitas laudatur.

When Aper has finished, Maternus (while complimenting him on his ’
spirited and ingenious defence of his own age) calls on Messalla to fulfil
his promise to set forth the causes of a decline which he himself regards
as an established fact. Messalla's speech (25-27) consists of a vigorous
vindication of the antiqui from Aper's accusations, and an attack on
the ‘ curling-tongs and jingle—jingle ' (calamistros et tinnitus) of such
later speakers as Maecenas and Gallio, with a general impeachment of
his own times as degenerate and effeminate. He is prepared to cite
examples from the past, and match them against any which Aper may
put forward, but Maternus again interrupts, and recalls the speaker to
the original theme. It is the explanation of the phenomenon, he sayS‚
that they wish to have from him, not a mere statement of fact. Messalla
then proceeds (ch. 28) to unfold the causes of the decline of eloquence
from two points of view, taking first the methods of early nurture and
theoretica] training which obtained in former days, and contrasting them
with the laxity and indifference of his own time (28-32)‚ and then, after
a few remarks from Maternus, comparing also the practical exercises
of the antiqui with those of the novi (33—35).

It is in this part of the treatise that the author of the Dialogue first
begins to discuss directly the answer to the question announced in the
opening sentence. That Messalla is meant to appear as a ‘laudator
temporis acti ’ is obvious from the fact that he leads off by at once attri-
buting the decline, not only of eloquence, but of the other arts as well to
desidia iuventutis et neglegentia parentum et inscitia praecipientium et oblivio
