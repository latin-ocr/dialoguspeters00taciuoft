108 CORNELII TA CI TI

cursus et spatia probant, sic est aliquis oratorum campuS‚ per
quem nisi liberi et soluti ferantur debilitatur ac frangitur

eloquentia.

Ipsam quin immo curam et diligentis stili anxie-
ιο tatem contrariam experimur,

quia saepe interrogat iudex

quando incipiaS, et ex interrogatione eius incipiendum est.
Frequenter probationibus et testibus audiendis silentium patronis

indicit.

*A quam

Unus inter haec dicenti aut alter adsistit, et res velutin

s. ετΐκ.

1 1. quando H, quando AB, quam quando AD, quam quando C, quam EV„ causam

quando Bekker‚ Baehrens.

1 2. testibus audiendis silentium patronis is my conj. ,

testibus sil. patronus codd. (except that H has a blank between testibus and patronus).
For patronus Haupt suggested impatiens (Halm), Orelli praetor, Weissenborn im-
portunus, Halm protinus or ultro, Meiser testibus patroni silentium.

ment: cp. ὡς ἔπος εἰπεῖν, ὡς εἷπεΐνε tr.
‘ most cases are nowadays generally
unfolded.' At 20. 2 and 31. 7 it=ple-
rumque.—Fere has a tendency to connect
itself with iam: but the text is different
from Cic. Verr. v. ξ 94 (‘ lucebat iam
fere’)‚ or pro Tull. ξ 21 (‘iam fere cum
lux appropinquaret ’).

6. quo modo . .
36. 33: 41. 9.

7. cursus et. spatia. A ‘spacious,
roomy tace-course’ is required to put a
racer ‘ on his mettle.' For the hendiadys
cp. Germ. xxxvii. 3 castra ac spatia:
Verg. Georg. iii. 202 Hie vel ad Elei
metas et maxuma campi Sudabit spatia.

oratorum campus. For the figure,
cp. Cic. Acad. ii. ξ 112 eum sit enim
campus in quo exsultare possit oratio, cur
eam tantas in angustias et Stoicorum in
dumeta compellimus. de Or. iii. ξ 71 ex
ingenti quodam oratorem immensoque
campo in exiguum sane gyrum compel-
litis. —Alzquz's is unusual, for quzdam.
John cites Cic. pro Arch. ξ 18 quasi
deorum aliquo dono atque munere: cp.
Germ. xlvi. 17.

8. liberi et, soluti. These words are
very frequently conjoined: Cic. Verr. ii. 2,
§ 185 animo soluto liberoque: ib. ξ 192
liberi ad causas solutique veniebant: de
Div. i. ξ 4 motu soluto et libero: pro
Plane. ξ 72: ad Att. i. 13, 2: pro Rab.
Post. 5 12: Sall. Cat. vi. 1. Sen. de
Ben. ii. 18, 5.

9. Ipsam quin immo, &c.‚ ‘Moreover
we know by experience t'hat even prepa-
ration and solicitude about the elaboration

. sic: cp. 25. 10

of what we write do more harm than
good ’ ι for the judge interrupts, and then
it is all over with us. In itself‚ excessive

preparation may lead to failure‚ if it
makes the speaker the hond-slave of what
he has prepared (see Quint. x. 7, 14
and 32: xii. 9, 16 sq.: xi. 2, 48 sq.) ι
it is worse if the judge is impatient or
out of temper. For diligentis stili cp.
Quint. x. 3, 5 sit primo vel tardus dum
diligens stilus: and for contrariam, see
on 35. 12.

10. saepe and frequenter correspond,
like ‘ modo . . . modo.’ John compares
saepe . . . nonnumquam, Vell. ii. 90, 2.

11. quando incipias ε ‘ when are you
coming to the point 2 ' Cp. 19. ad sm.

ex interrogatione, not ‘ with the point
indicated in his question ' (as Wolff):
tr. ‘ when he puts this question.'

12. probationibus is generally taken
as referring to the third constituent part of
a judicial speech: after the ‘ introduction ’
and the ‘ narrative ' came the ‘ proof‚’ the
‘ refutation,’ and the ‘closing appeal’
(Quint. iii. 9. 1). Those who adopt this
view delete patronus, with Novak, who says,
⁴ addidit librarius patronio, subiectum de·
siderans.’—But I venture to read patronis,
and to supply audiendis in the text: the
meaning may be that when the judge does
not request counsel to ‘get to business:
he does even worse,—euts him short, and
proceeds to hear ‘ proof ' and evidence.
This seems to account better for the
plural ‘probationibus’: the examination
of witnesses generally followed the main
speeches for the prosecution and defence
(Cic. in Verr. i. 1 ς 55). For Tacitus‘s
use of the gerundive as equivalent to a
final clause, after a verb, see Dr. 206 B.

13. unus aut alter: see on 21. 6. For
inter haec, cp. Ann. xi. 35. 1: inter quae,
i. 12, 1, and frequently.
