DIAL'OGUS DE ORA TORIBUS. 43
hunc diem colliguntur, uniu's hominis aetas. Nam ipse ego in
Britannia vidi senem qui se fateretur ei pugnae interfuisse qua
Caesarem inferentem arma Britanni arcere litoribus et pellere
adgressi sunt. Ita si eum qui' armatus C. Caesari restitit vel
captivitas vel voluntas vel fatum aliquod in urbem pertraxisset,
aeque idem et Caesarem ipsum et Ciceronem audire potuit et
nostris quoquev actionibus interesse. Proximo quidem congiario
ipsi vidistis plerosque senes qui se a divo quoque Augusto semel
atque iterum accepisse congiarium narrabant. Ex quo colligi
potest et Corvinum ab illis et Asinium audiri potuisse (nam

Corvinus in medium usque Augusti principatum, Asinius paene ad

17. fateretur ABDH, fatebatur EV2CA.

16. colliguntur. So, of the result of a
calculation‚ Germ. xxxvii. 9 ducenti ferme
et decern anni colliguntur. A somewhat
similar use occurs ch. 24. below, ad fin.
Tr. ‘ The result arrived at is‚’ &c.

17. fateretur. The subjunctive is
motived not so much by the form of re·
ported speech (cp. qui se . . . narrabant,
below) as by the idea contained in the
relative, ‘so old that ’z cp. canerent,
defenderent 12. 13. For fateri in the
sense of declarare (with acc. and inf.) cp.
Ann. i. 13, 20 fateretur suscipi a se im-
perium: ii. 13. 6: so Quintilian (who
also6uses prefiteri) i. 6, 233 10. 37: vii.

21. potuit. This use of the perfect
indicative in such clauses indicates the
possibility (or duty, obligation, διο.) more
unconditionally than the plupf. subj. would
do: e. g. Liv. xxii. 12 deleri totus exer-
citus potuit si fugientes persecuti victores
essent. Roby, ς 1566.

ally gifts of oil, wine, &c. (Liv. xxv. 2, 8 ε
Plin. N. H. xiv. 14, 17): for other in-
stances of money donations, cp. Ann. iii.
29, 11 : xii. 41, 7: xiii. 31, 7. See also
the Monumentum Ancyranum, iii. 7-21 :

tivum was different, being specially used
of a largess to the soldiers.

often used for etiam, 39. 22 ε cp. ipsorum

2 5. nam, &c. This parenthesis has
greatly exercised the critics, who have
proposed various methods of correcting
Aper’s mistake. It is undoubted that
Corvinus died in A. D. 8, and that Pollio
died in A.D. 5: both of them might there-
fore have been said to have lived ‘ almost
to the close of ’ the reign of Augustus.
In order to justify the language of the
text, Corvinus would need to have died
about B.C. 14! Little is gained by trans-
posing the names (Borghesi) in order
to bring out the fact that it was Pollio
who died first: ‘in medium usque A.
principatum’ is really as incorrect for
him as it is for Corvinus, though et . . . et
in the previous clause seems to show that
the speaker at first meant to place Pollio
first in point of time (cp. 17. 3). We must
regard the statements in the text as another
illustration of Aper’s liability to error.

Gudeman proposes to reject the paren-
thesis altogether as an interpolation, based
probably on 38. 19 ab ipso tamen 1³01--
