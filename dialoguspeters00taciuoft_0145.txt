⁴ PG. Licinius Calvus, a contemporary
of Caelius, was the most prominent of
the stricter Atticists, and is censured by
Cicero in the Brutus (ξς 284—291) for the
narrowness os his views. A poet himself,
he was the friend of Catullus, and, like
Catullus, an opponent of Caesar. Cp.
25. 18: 34. ad fin.

M. Iunius Brutus (Β. c. 85—42) was
more distinguished as a philosopher than
as an orator (see 21. 22), though Cicero
speaks of his eloquenee in the language of
extravagant eulogy, Brut. ς 22 and else-
where. On his philosophical works, see
⁴ Cic. Acad. i. 3, 12 (with Dr. Reid's note).
He wrote, among other treatises, a dis-
course ‘de Virtute,’ from which Seneca
quotes, Cons. ad Helv. ix. 4 sqq.

sex et quinquaginta annos. There
is some doubt about the number. Taking
the date of Cicero's death as the starting-
point (cp. mox, and ab interitu Ciceronis
below), 56 (4² 4- 14) ought to be right:
hence the emendation of Lipsius. Cp.
Suet. Aug. 8 primum eum Antonio M.-
que Lepido deinde tantum cum Antonio
per duodecim fere annos, novissime per
quattuor et quadraginta solus rem p.
tenuit. But then the sum does not work
out properly, and we must either suppose
that centum et viginti armi, below (ep.
24. 13), is a round number (which may
seem strange when everything else is given
in such detail) or else make an additional
correction there. The Harleian MS.
gives viii for sex, which would exaetly
square the sum, but by no method of
reckoning can Augustus be said to have
reigned fifty-eight years. We might make
it fifty-seven, by counting from January
43 Β. (3., when he received the imperium
and the rank of propraetor (Cic. Phil. v.
16, 45) ; and indeed it was usual to reckon
anniversaries from the first ‘ dies imperii‚'
which in the case of Octavian was January
17, when he actually received the fasces,
though Cicero’s proposal was made on
January 1. Accordingly it has been pro-
posed to read septem : but this seems to
be vetoed by mox (‘thereafter’), which
shows clearly that the starting-point of
the calculation is the eentral statement of
the previous sentence, the date of Cicero's
death, or, as practically equivalent, Oeta-
vian's election (se . . . sufficit). Possibly
before beginning the sum with the fifty·
six years credited to Augustus, the writer
added one for the preceding year (cp.
mox): this would give a total of 119,
