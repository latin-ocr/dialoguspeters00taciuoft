That Tacitus did not lay aside all at once the ‘rotundity’ of expression
which these examples illustrate might be shown by citations from his
later works. Cp. for example Agr. iv. 16 incensum acflagrantem animum 3
ibid. 17 scilicet sublime et erectum ingenium pulchritudinem ac speciem
magnae excelsaeque gloriae vehementius quam caute adpetebat3 Agr. vi. 14
quiete et otio <as also xlii. 5); Germ. xxiv. 7 extremo ac novissimo iactu,
and many other instances which help to show the continuity of his
stylistic development, in spite of the wide gulf that separates his latest
from his earliest literary effort.

Some of the parallelisms from Quintilian quoted in the foregoing list,
and others which will be found in the noteS, will remind the reader
of the points of contact which exist between the author of the Dialogue
and the great contemporary professor of rhetoric. It is, of course,
extremely crude to say, with some critics—-even while accepting the
view that the composition of the work must be assigned to the reign
of Titus. or the early years of Domitian—that Quintilian's Institutio must
have served‚ especially in regard to phraseology and terminology‚ as the
model for whole passages of the Dialogus. The Institutio was not
published till the earlier part of the last decade of the century, and it
is impossible therefore that it can have been in Tacitus's hands ten
or eleven years previously. But the materials of which it consists had
been put together in the course of Quintilian's long career as a teacher
of rhetoric: and if Tacitus had not actually studied under him, he had
no doubt methods of acquainting himself with the substance and general
character of the teaching which was being imparted to the youth of
Rome. The similarity of the subject matter of the Dialogue to that
of portioris of the Institutio is enough in itself to suggest inevitable
resemblanceS. The proper methods of elementary instruction (cp. Inst.
