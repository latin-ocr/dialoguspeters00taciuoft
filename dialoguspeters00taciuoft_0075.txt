MANUS CRIPTS. lxiii

probability is that we owe the minor works, not to Poggi0, but to a Pope
who was also an earnest scholar, and practically the founder of the
Vatican Library at Rome. In the year 1451, Nicholas V had sent the
monk Enoch of Ascoli, formerly one of his most intimate associateS,
into France‚ Germany, and Denmark, to search for manuscripts and to
take copies. There is still extant a letter in which he recommends his
emissary to the good offices of Ludwig of Erlichshausen. After referring
to his intention of making a collection of Greek and Latin MSS„ worthy

of the Supreme Pontiff and the Apostolic See, Pope Nicholas specifies
the motive of Enoch⁷s mission in the following passage: sed cum multi

libri ex antiquis deficiant, qui culpa superiorum temporum sunt deperditi, ad
inquirendum et transcribendum si reperiantur eiusmodi libros mittimus
dilectum filium Enoch Esculanum virum doctum grecis et latinis litteris,

ᾖ, familiarem nostrum, qui diversa loca et monasteria inquirat, siquis ex ipsis

 

deperditis apud vos libris reperiretur. Idcirco nostri contemplatione velzs
omnes tui territorii libros sibi ostendere, antiquos presertim et prisce scrip-
ture, et simul permittere ut in tuo territorio scribi possit expensis nostris.
Nolumus enim ut aliquis liber surripiatur, sed tantummodo ut fiat copia
transcribendi super quibus ipse Enoch tecum loquetur latius ex parte
nostra ¹.

At first, Enoch does not seem to have fulfilled the high expectations
“that had been formed of the prospects of his mission. Poggi0, in
particular, appears to have had a poor idea of his qualifications. Enoch
had been a pupil of Filelfo, with whom Poggio had interchanged such
courtesies as were common among the scholars of that day; and he was
undertaking a task in which Poggio himself had already been more than
once disappointed, notably in an effort to procure a complete copy of
Livy which he had been told was to be found in a Cistercian monastery
near Liibeek. In a letter addressed to Fr. Coppin0, Poggio says that, in
two yearS, Enoch had found nothing that even an uneducated person
would find it worth his while to read ². Porphyrio's commentary on
Horace and Apicius seem to have been the chief results of Enoch’s early
efforts. But the air was sull of the rumour of new discoveries. The
times were favourable‚ and such a mission as Enoch's was not likely to
prove a failure in the end. We know from Poggio’s letters to Niccolo
Niccoli ³ (1425-2 8) that he had himself formerly been on the track of some
