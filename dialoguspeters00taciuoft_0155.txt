DJALOGUS DE ORATORIBUS.

alte repetita series et multarum divisionum ostentatio et mille
argumentorum graduS, et quiquid aliud aridissimis Hermagorae

et Apollodori libris praecipitur, in honore erat3

quod si quis

odoratus philosophiam videretur et ex ea locum aliquem orationi

suae insereret, in caelum laudibus ferebatur.

Nec mirum ; erant

enim haec nova et incognita, et ipsorum quoque oratorum
paucissimi praecepta rhetorum aut philosophorum placita cogno-

verant.

narrationis alte repetita series, lit.
‘ the thread of the narrative carried far
back ' : far-fetched statements of the case.
Narratio was the second of the five parts
of an oration: exordium, narratio, pro-
batio, refutatio, peroratio.

12. ostentatio. the‘ parade’ or ‘dis-
play’ of numerous heads. Quint. vii. 1, 1
divisio rerum plurium in singulas, partitio
singularum in partes discretio· cp. id.
iv. 5 where parti‘tzo is the generic term
used.

mille argumentorum gradus, ‘ the
countless stages of the proof.’ Cp. 20. 6
cursu argumentorum.

13. Hermagorae. The reference here
is probably to the greatest of the rheto-
ricians who bore this name, mentioned
by Cicero in de Invent. i. 6, 8, ibid. 9, 12,
Brutus, §§ 263, 271, and frequently by
Quintilian. Some time in the second
century B.C., he drew up an elaborate
system of rhetoric, which was afterwards
very generally followed. ‘ It concemed
itself almost exclusively with inventio,
with the discovery of arguments as op-
posed to style, and it dissected with in-

dorei, or school of Apollodorus, it is
more probable that Tacitus is referring
here to the elder Hermagoras, whose
influence was so great on Cicero and the
former generation of orators.

14. Apollodori. This was Apollo·
dorus of Pergamum, the friend and teacher
of Octavianus, who took him with him
(Suet. Aug. 89) in a journey he made
from Rome to Apollonia in B. C. 45. See
again Quint. iii. 1, 17.

15. odoratus. The dictt. give only
one other example of this use, from Lac-
tantius (vii. 1 , 1 1) veritatem leviter odorari.
Odorari :libare‚ · to get a smattering of‚’
‘ dip into.’ Wolff compares Cic. ad Att.
iv. 16, 11 res fluit ad interregnum, et
est nonnullus odor dictaturae, ‘there is
something like a dictatorship in the air.'

locum, ‘common-place': a topic or
reflection not peculiar to the case in hand,
but of a more general character: cp. 20.
16, 22. 6. ‘Any subject or topic of a
general character that is capable of being
variously applied and constantly intro-
duced on any appropriate occasion is
a locus communim any common current
maxim or alternative proposition . . . .
Again, invi'dza, avaritia, testes i''mmzci,

genious subtlety the different kinds of potentes amici (Quint. v. 12, ἐξ 15, 16)

issues raised, more particularly in the
forensie branch of oratory’ (Sandys,
Introd. to Orator, p. xxxvii). It is often
represented as having been too subtle and
scholastic to be of service for the practical
training of the statesman or the advocate.
Cp. with am‘dissimis here, Quint. iii. 11,
21— 22 .—There was a younger Herma-
goras (Quint. iii. 1, 18, cp. §16) who
also wrote a treatise τέχναι ῥητορικαὶ in
six books, Though his followers were
called, after the name of his master,
Theodorei, in opposition to the Apollo·

may fumish loci communes; or they may
be constructed de virtute, de officio, de
aequo et bono, de dignitate, utilitate,
honore, ignominia, and on other moral
topies' (Cope’s Introd. to Arist. Rhet.
p. 130). Cp. Cic. de Invent. ii. §482
de Or. iii. ς 106: Or. ξ 126.

19. eortina. ‘ Videtur ἀψὶς basilicarum
in quibus iudicia centumviralia habeban-
tur significari‚' Halm. The word, which
is used for a ‘ vault,’ or ‘dome,' certainly
indicates here some round space available
for the accommodatiori of the public.
