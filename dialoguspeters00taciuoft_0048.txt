the piece. Δ In regard to this point, the interpretation of ch. 1. 11 (cum
singuli diuersas quidem sed probabiles causas adferrent, dum formam sui
quisque et animi et ingenii redderent) is of the greatest importance. To
exclude Secundus from the reference here, would be to practically limit-
it to Messalla and Maternus: on the strictest interpretation of diversas
causas adferre—occurring as this phrase does after eandem hanc quaes-⁴
tionem (cp. 1. 1) pertractantes—Aper does not seem to come in, because
it is not his province to suggest any causae for a decline which he does
not admit ¹. Again, if the lacuna really extends over about one-ninth
of the whole treatise ², it is difficult to imagine what it can have con-
tained except on the theory that Secundus also spoke ³, Messalla cannot
have gone on much longer. His subject had been prescribed for him
by Maternus in ch. 33. 8 quibus exercitationibus iuvenes iam et forum
ingressuri confirmare et alere ingenia sua soliti sint ; and unless he
elaborated the criticism of contemporary methods with which his speech
breaks off, that subject may be said to have been overtaken before the
lacuna occurs, On the other hand, it is argued that it is more con-
siste‘nt with what we know of the retiring and unwarlike ⁴ disposition
of Secundus to conceive him as confining himself to assisting the progress
of the aetion by appropriate interpellations: also that no reference is
made to him in the closing chapter, where Maternus, Messalla, and Aper
bring the discussion to a close. The theory that we actually have part
of a speech by Secundus in what follows after the lacuna, will be better
dealt with in connexion with Maternus,

The fourth and last of the interlocutors in the Dialogus, Curiatius
Maternus, is the most interesting of all. The author obviously intended
to put him forward as the leading personage of the piece. It is in his
house that the discussion takes place. He is introduced as a well-known
celebrity‚ who does not stand in need of even the brief characterization

¹ The passage is a well-known crux, admits, not a decline, but a change
and the text is corrupt. There is of (182 8: 19 sqq.). On this interpretation
course much to be said for John's view Neque enim defuit, &c. (line 18) is added
that so important a disputant as Aper to explain the phrase diversas causas in
cannot possibly be omitted from the line 15. But as the writer’s sympathies

stantissimis viris et excogitata subtiliter et his ap reciation of his great abilities, it

John thinks that diversas causas (in ² See pp. lxxxi-lxxxii.
