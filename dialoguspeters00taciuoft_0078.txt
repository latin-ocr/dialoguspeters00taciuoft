other hand it may be that he had promised more than he could perform,
as might very conceivably be the case if the codices which he mentioned
to Poggio were the property of another monastery. It is on this theory
that Fulda becomes possible. Fulda is only about thirty miles from
Hersfeld, and is believed to have possessed in earlier days an ancient
copy of the works of Tacitus. Indeed the only certain reference to the
historian's writings before the fifteenth century is made by Ruodolphus,
a monk of Fulda, of whom we are able to infer that he must have used,
about the year 863 A. D., a codex containing both the Germania and the
Annals, and therefore probably complete.

The point has been made the subject of numerous conjectures
Reifferscheid's latest view1 was that Ruodolphus may have borrowed
the codex from Corvey, after the fashion of that time. OtherS‚ more
probably, regard Fulda itself as the home of the complete archetype
which Ruodolphus used, and which must of course have been more
ancient than any codex now extant. However this may be, we may
be pretty certain that it was not this archetype, nor any part of it, that
Enoch· found. In fact it is improbable that Enoch’s codex was older
than the thirteenth century. This is an inference which may be fairly
based on the state in which the text of the minor works has come down
to us, The manuscript to which we owe their survival must have
abounded in those abbreviations ² and compendia which are absent from
manuscripts of more remote date, but which by that time had been
developed into a regular system. We are in this way enabled to explain
the difference between the text of the early books of the Annals, which
has been recovered from the First Medicean‚ and that of the Germania
and the Dialogue. The latter, as also the Suetonius fragment, have
suffered considerably from the ignorance of their first copyistS, and
especially from their inability to interpret some of the compendia referred
to above. In order to gather up the various threads of the tradition of
Tacitus, Ulrichs constructed the hypothesis that the codex used by
vRuodolphus at Fulda (eighth or ninth century) was copied in the latter
part of the eleventh century for or in the monastery of Corvey, and that
the first part of this apographon was lent to Hersfeld in the thirteenth
century, where after being copied it was lost. It is to the copy made at
Hersfeld that we are in all probability indebted for Enoch's discovery.
Through his agency, the minor works of Tacitus found their way, just about
the time of Poggio’s death, to Italy—probably first to Florence‚ and after-
wards (before 1470), enlarged by the addition of the Agricola, to Rome ³.
