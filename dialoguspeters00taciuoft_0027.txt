 

THE QUESTION OF AUTHORSHJP AND DA TE. XV

on his return in 74, and was therefore in that year at the height of

his farne ¹.

Taking the end of A. D. 74, therefore, as on the whole the most prob-
able date for the historical groundwork of the Dialogm, we have next to
inquire how it suits the facts of Tacitus’s life, especially in regard to the
use of the phrase iuvenis admodum, 1. 13. The usage of imperial times
shows that this expression might embrace a period extending from, say,
the eighteenth to the twenty-fourth year ². At the date of the historian's

¹ ΤΙιε known facts in the life of Eprius
Marcellus are of importance for the ques-
tion under discussion. His full name and
the various magistracies which he held
are detailed in an inscription from the
province of Cyprus, found at Capua, and
preserved at Naples (Henzen 5425):
Τ. Clodio, M.f., Pal(atina sc. tribu),
Eprio Marcello, cos. II, auguri, curioni
maximo, sodali Augustali, pr(aetori)
oer(egrino), procosAsiae IlI (tertium, i. e.
:hree years) provincia Cypros. In A. D. 48
'ne was appointed, for a single day, to a
vacancy in the praetorship, occasioned by
the deposition of Silanus, Ann. xii. 4. In
57 he appears to have been legatus pro-
praetore of Lycia, when he was accused
of malversation, ib. xiii. 33: but escaping
a verdict of guilty, he afterwards became
consul suffectus,-—pr0bably in the year
ΔΑ) 61. In 66 he undertook, on Nero's
instructions, the impeachment of Thrasea
Paetus, and was rewarded with an hono-
rarium of ζμ, 500. This brought him into
contact with Helvidius Priscus, Thrasea’s
son-in-law, who was banished at the same
:ime as Thrasea was put to death; and
Helvidius made more than one attempt,
after his return from exile in 68, to take
vengeance on the enemy of his house.
From Hist. iv. 6, 6 it would appear that
his zeal in the conduct of a direct im-
peachment had somewhat abated before
the death of Galba (mox dubia voluntate
Galbae multis senatorum deprecantibus
omisit Priscus, l. c.); but we read in the
ἱῖῗῗηᾝζῗᾷᾶξξῗὲῗὲ iffffiffsss 321¹}ss
the proposal to send an embassay to Ves-
asian, the new emperor (end of A. D. 69—
{list iv. 7—10) the other, of a more direct
character, in the course of the year fol-
lowing (Eprium urgebat, ardentibus pa-
trum animis, Hist. iv. 4 3). It is probable
that this was the occasion referred to in
ch. 5. 30 (Quid aliud infestis patribus
nuper Eprius Marcellus quam eloquen-
tiam suam opposuit Β), when Marcellus

triumphed by his eloquence in spite of
the hostility of the senate. The phrase
ardentibus patrum animis, quoted above
from the Histories, has a certain resem-
blance to infestis patribus: and the
incident was a memorable one, cum
glisceret certamen, hinc multi bonique,
inde pauci et validi pertinacibus odiis
tenderent, consumptus per discordiam
dies, Hist. iv. 43 ad fin. In any case,
the triumph of Marcellus recorded in the
Dialogue (5. 30) must have occurred about
the same time: it cannot have been later,
for from A.D. 71 to A.D. 73 he was away
acting as proconsul of Asia, and Helvidius
seems speedily to have fallen out of
favour. On his return, Marcellus became
a second time consul suffectus, in A. D. 74:
see Henzen 5418: a. d. XII. k. Iunias
Q. Petilio Ceriale Caesio Rufo II, Τ. Clodio
Eprio Marcello II cos. He was now (at
the time of the Dialogue) at the height of
his power: cp. especially 8. 18 (quoted
above). But he afterwards conspired
against Vespasian, and was driven to com-
mit suicide in A. D. 79 (Dio, lxvi. 16, 3).
2 Domitian, for example, at the age of
eighteen is styled iuvenis admodum by
Tacitus himself, Agr. vii. 9: and Hel·
vidius Priscus is described in the same
way (Hist. iv. 5, 6) at the same age. In
Cicero, too, a similar phrase (adulescens
admodum) is applied to L. Crassus in
his twenty-first year (de Off. ii. 13, 17).
In the same way Velleius (ii. 41, 3)
speaks of Caesar as admodum iuvenis
in his twenty-fourth year. On the other
hand, the use of the terms iuvenis,
adulescens, and even adulescentulus. by
themselves, varied considerably: thus
Sallust calls Caesar adulescentulus at the
age of thirty-six (Cat. xlix. 2) : M. Brutus
is styled adulescens by Nepos even at the
age of forty-two (Att. viii. 2): Pompey
again, at the age of twenty-four, is de-
scribed as peradulescens and adulescentulus
by Cicero, pro Leg. Man. ξ 61. See
Eckstein, p. 373 Weinkauff, p. xliii.
