iv INTRODUCTION.

the Dialogue· with the best works of its kind, as a genuine monument of
classical antiquity. At first he thought that he had discovered in it Quin-
tilian's lost treatise‚ De causis corruptae eloquentiae ¹3 and accordingly
the title under which the work appeared in his original Antwerp edition
was ‘ F ab. Quintiliani, ut videtur, Dialogus an sui saeculi oratores et quare
concedant: Cornelio Tacito falso inscriptus? But as Quintilian was born
about 35 A. n„ he could hardly have described himself as being still
iuvenis admodum (Dial. 1. 12) in 74-75 A.D., the year in which the conver-
sation out of which the Dialogue resulted is generally understood to have
taken place. This consideration was in itself enough to shake, even in ’
his own mind, the view to which Lipsius had given a perhaps too hasty
expression3 and so in Subsequent issues of his work Tacz'to vulgo
inscriptus takes the place of Tacito falso inscriptus, while in his third
(Leyden) edition of 1585, he states his doubts about Quintilian, though still
convinced of the difficulties in the way of the traditional view. Lipsius's
final attitude waS, in fact, that which is adopted by more than one critic
of the present day—a judicial Non liquet.

But though he expressly disclaimed any wish to impose his own
opinions on his contemporaries or successors (nibil aliis· praeeo quod
sequantur), the authority of his great name sufficed to induce a general
suspension of judgement during the two centuries which succeeded his
epoch. Some scholars adhered to the Tacitean tradition, others advocated
Quintilian²z some took a new departure, ascribing the Dialogue to the
younger Pliny, or to Suetonius, or to the poet-pleader who is its central
figure, Curiatius Maternus. But Pliny could only have been thirteen
years of age when he is supposed to have been present at the conversa-
tion reported in the treatise: Suetonius is chronologically still more
impossible: while the theory about Maternus is altogether inconsistent
with the ‘ Setting ' of the Dialogue, which purports to be written by one
who, so sar from taking a leading part in the conversation narrated, had
been merely a listener to the views of others ⁸. The safest position was
