THE INTERLOCUTORS ΛΝΒ THEIR PARTS. xxxiii

who is conscious of what he owes to his art. He had come up to Rome
from a Gaulish province as a novus homo, and had risen by the force of
, 3 his eloquence to high office. The approval of his audience‚ the gratitude

3 of clientS, the favour of the great, are· to him the things chiefly worth
’ἐ striving for: why a man who could command all these should elect to be
a poet rather than an orator passes his comprehension. As a stylist, he
is the representative of the tendencies of which Quintilian expresses
⁴ his disapproval. There is a certain striving after effect, which seems to
indicate an exaltation of form over substance3 and in the ‘ nominis contro—
ι versia' with which he introduces his disparagement of the ‘antiqui’ (16, 17)
ὲ we recognize the sophistic habit of debaoe, by which he might have stolen
· a march upon a more unwary audience. Aper is all for piquancy and
. point: colores sententiarum, lumina orationis, nitor et cultus descriptionum,
’π —these were evidently as much to him as they were to Seneca himself.
“ Even Cicero he appraises by this standard, and finds him just tolerable.
’ It was in his more mature years that Cicer0, according to Aper, began
ᾗ to discover what true style really was: locos quoque laetz‘ores attemptavit
et quasdam sententias invenit, utique in iis orationibus quas senior iam
ἱ et iuxta finem vitae composuit, id est, postquam usuque et experimentis
-.. didicerat quod optimum dicendi genus esset, 22. ¹7. His earlier speeches
'are‘ not free from the faults of a former age: he is slow and tedious,
wanting in passion, and destitute of what Aper and his friends valued
- most, showy passages, epigrams‚ and ‘ quotable bits ’ : pauci sensus apte
'. et cum quodam lumine terminantur: nihil excerpere, nihil referre possis, et
velut in rudi artificio firmus sane paries et duraturus sed non satis expolitus
‘⁷ et splendens, 1. c. His own position he defines in a well-known sentence which
⁷ occurs in the same context: ego autem oratorem, sicut locupletem ac lautum
patrem familiae, non eo tantum volo tecto tegi quod imbrem ac ventum arceat,
sed etiam quod visum et oculos delectet, non ea solum instrui supellectile quae
’ » necessariis usibus sufficiat, sed esse in apparatu eius et aurum et gemmas, ut
, .ς·ιιηιι’νι·Δ in manus et aspicere saepius libeat. It is somewhat surprising that
2⁸ so eminent a representative of contemporary tendencies as Aper evidently
ΞΓ was should nowhere be even alluded to by Quintilian. We may infer
⁷ *  that, if he was still alive when Tacitus wrote, he had at least withdrawn
Ῑῖ from practice at the bar (cp. tum . . . contemnebat . . . nesciebat, ch. 2),
f '³ and that he died without leaving behind him anything fit to enter into the
