 

PREFACE

——-0§-—

THIS book may be regarded as a companion volume to the
edition of the Tenth Book of Quintilian’s Institutio which was
published in the autumn of 1891. The one has led to the other:
indeed it was while preparing the Quintilian that it occurred to
‘ me to take the Dz‘alogue also in hand. The motive was the
same in both cases—a wish to do something to remove from the
scholarship of this country the reproach of neglecting two of the
most interesting specimens of Latin literature, or of relying
sor a knowledge of them almost entirely on foreign sources.

The reader to whom the Dialogus de Oratoribus is a new work
will find much in its character, contentS, and history to account
for the extent of space which I have claimed from my indul-
gent publishers for its adequate treatment. Scholars know
that it is brimful of problems, though an exhaustive discussion
of these problemS, such as I have endeavoured to give in the
Introduction, has hitherto been conspicuously absent from the
achievements of Latinists at home. For studentS, again, the
treatise is of the utmost value, as supplying a field for the
exercise of many of the 'qualities-such as sense of style, literary
judgment and critical abilitysswithout which a knowledge of Latin
will often prove only a barren possession. In this connection,
I may quote the words in which Classen says there will be
general agreement ε ‘dass der Dialog in seinem massigen Umfang
ungemein reichen Stoff zu den anziehendsten Discussionen der
verschiedensten Art darbietet ; und diese Eigenschaft eben ist eS,
die ihn nach meiner Ansicht ganz besonders zur gemeinsamen
Lectiire mit reifern Schiilern‚ die wir zu selbststandigem Nach-

denken und umsichtigem Urtheil anzuleiten wunschen‚ geeignet
macht.’
