It was an examination of the neglected Vz‘ndobonensz's Dccxr (V2) that
led Scheuer to his conclusions. He found that it is nearly akin to E,
and almost in exact agreement with it where E shows the readings of X
instead of those of its own class Y. Both therefore derive from a common
source, which must have been a truer representative of Y than that to
which CAD are to be traced. The supposition that either codex was
copied from the other is excluded by a list of variants in which each
'shows individual peculiarities of its own. Instead of E having been
corrected from A or B, the opposite is the case. E is sometimes in
agreement with AB, or with B alone, where V, does not follow it, and
we may therefore infer that their original (y¹) had been corrected after V2
was copied from it. In this emended state it was probably used by
PontanuS, or by both Pontanus and the copyist of B. Scheuer next
proves the common origin of CAD, which had already been partly
established by Binde ¹. Their source he designates y²‚ and infers that its
disagreement with ABEV² must be attributed to caprice or carelessness
on the part of the copyist, while the text of the lost archetype Y may be
'restored by the agreement of y1 with A and B. The fact that D often
forsakes its own class to agree with A and B, where its kindred EV2 and
CA are in disagreement, Scheuer explains by supposing for D (or rather
for its original, as Baehrens had suggested) what Michaelis had asserted
for E, namely‚ correction out of the X family. In proof of this the

following places are quoted where D has been ‘ contaminated' from X
¹ and Y: 30. 2 vocantis D, vocatzls· X, vocant Y; 41. 3 quis enim quidem
quod nemo D, quidem quod nemo A, quis enim Y3 37. 19 est habendus D,
habendus est X, habendus Y.

Some of Scheuer's conclusions rest no doubt on a superstructure of
hypothesis, but his general theory marks an advance on the work of pre-
vious critics. It seems to me, however, that future speculation as to the
inter-relationship of the various codices will have to take account of the
hitherto neglected Harlez‘anus, which is certainly of great importance for
the history of the constitution of the text. 1 now proceed to report the
result os my examination of this interesting manuscript. Its official
description is as follows: Brit. Mus. Harley 2639, vellum ; 8 >< 5} inches ;
ff. 43, fifteenth century. Contains ‘ Suetonii tranquilli de grammaticis et
rhetoribus libri duo,' ff. 2—14 v. : ‘ C. Cornelii Taciti Dialogus de Oratori-
bus Claris,' ff. 15-42 v. On thelfirst folio the name of its last owner is
written ‘Ambrosii Bonvici‚ 1687! This was Ambrose Bonwicke (1652-
1722)‚ scholar of St. John's College, Oxford, in 1669, Librarian in 1670,
