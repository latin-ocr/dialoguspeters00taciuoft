the use of pronouns (ille . . . iste, hic . . . is) which distinguish the two
families of MSS. Scheuer (after Binde) has reckoned that both agree
thirty-one times in showing ille, and ten times in iste3 there remain
twenty places where X gives title and Y ille ¹. Michaelis generally adhered,
in his critical edition, to AB and iste, but was forced to accept ille at

30. 21 (where the pronoun is thrice repeated, per anaphoram), while at
6. 7 he takes ipsos from E, with all editors. Binde, who gives an

exhaustive treatment of the subject in the second chapter of his disserta-
tion, thought that in the Y class iste had been deleted ‘ ubi nudum, ubi
ante suurn nomen, ubi post primurn adiectivum, si substantivo apponuntur
duo adiectiva‚ positum erat'3 but Scheuer rightly doubts how a copyist
could have arrived at such a ‘ law,' and quotes against it the instances at
23. 73 41. 20 3 26. 6 (where there is a general agreement for iste in the
MSS.).

It seems certain that AB cannot be invariably right, while on the other
hand the Y class cannot be followed in all cases. All editors agree in
altering isti (the reading of all the codd.) to illi at 41. 20 3 on the other
hand there is no dubiety about librum istum 3. 6 3 tragoediae istae 3. 15 3
comitatus istos 11. 13. As in other textual difficulties, an eclectio method
must be pursued in deciding between X and Y where they disagree3 for
instance, I accept ista from AB at 19. 4, and, with equal probability,
z'stos at 10. 23, but reject it at 12. 16. Other passages for comparison
are 13. 33 13. 193 21. 283 24. 12 3 and 25. 5 where the Y class
gives illos and the X class ictos-3 12. 203 13. 13 16. 5; 18. 73 23. 23
and 33. 22 where Y=illua⁷, and X=istud3 9. 203 12. 83 13. 193
14. 173 20. 43 30. 243 and 31. 15 where Y=illa and X=zlrta3 4. 9
and 23. 13 where Y=illam and X=istam 3 19. 9 where Y=ille and X=
iste.

A similar difficulty arises (as frequently in other MSS) about the use
of iis and hz's. Examples are: his most codd„ iis B3 30. 16 iis AB, his
EV2CAH‚ hiis D (as again at 11. 6) 3 34. 34 iis ABCAH, his BV„ Is D
(cp. 31. 4) 3 42. 5 iis ABC, bis EV2DH 3 14. 18 iis ABCAD, his EV,H;
24. 8 iis ABCAD‚ lzis EV2H: cp. 25. 9 iis-dem ABCADH, hisdem EV23
35. 13 his· ABEV2D, iis CA3 37. 9 his ABEV2DH, iis CA. The prefer·
enee of C for iis may be noted in the last two places: cp. 5. 2 iis CAD,

his ABEv2H3 8. 21 iss can, hes AEV, [ἐξ] Β, om. H. and edd. vet

² There can be little doubt that this bility of misinterpretation is evident from
must be due to the similarity of com· the occurrence (Dial. 14. 17) of iam in

pendia. It is remarkable, as Binde has CAD for illa EV2H‚ ista AB ἐι-ῶς while
pointed out, that AB never give iste at all

in the Suetonius fragment, and only once at 19. 4 D actually shows Ξ for illa Y,
in the Germania (x. 17) : but the proba· ista X.
