lxxiv INTR ODUCTION.

The family-trec constructed by Michaelis may be exhibited thus :—
[The archetype of Fulda, eighth or ninth century]

[The <Hersfeld ?) codex, found by Enoch of Ascoli,
of about the thirteenth century]

[Enoch’s copy of this codex]

[X] Ἦ]

[The codex of Pontanus] A [ x ] D
l ΓᾸ-ῑ

Β C Δ

BaehrenS, on the other hand, took Δ and E for direct descendants
of Y, while from a third copy of Y, now lost, he supposed C and D to
have sprung,—the former before, the latter after their original had been
corrected from some member of the X family. His method of repre-
senting the genealogy of the Y family is as follows :—

[Y]
T]

 

ἴ] ὲ

 

 

Γ-ῄ- l

C D

Scheuer has shown that both Michaelis and Baehrens were wrong.
He first proves, against Michaelis, that E cannot be derived from C, and
that it is impossible to believe that ECA are the offspring of the same
parent MS., as in the table of Michaelis. His tree he gives as under :—

[Y]
