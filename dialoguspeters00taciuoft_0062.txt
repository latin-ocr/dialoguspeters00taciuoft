1 INTRODUCTION.

is even allowed (23 ad init.) to raise a laugh over the hackneyed esse
videatur as well as over some of Cicero’s inferior witticisms (rotam
Fortunae, ius Verrinam, ibid.). Messalla, on the other hand, quotes him
as a high authority on the necessity of a wide philosophical culture for
the orator (32. 28).

The search for specific resemblances in the Dialogue to the language
and phraseology of Cicero is liable to be overdone ¹. Little is to be
gained by recording fortuitous coincidences of expression between two
authors, except in cases where the phrases used by both are marked by
something more or less characteristic and striking. In this view, such
expressions as the following may be noted as being not improbably (see the
notes) conscious reminiscences of Cicero rather than the ‘ current coin’
of the language of Tacitus's own day: diem eximere, 19. 103 contro-
versias tueri, 10. 37; redolent antiquitatem, 21. 183 animorum venas
tenere, 31. 19. Other resemblances will be found duly noted in the
commentary‚ but it may be convenient to give a re'sume' of them also
here (cp. Goelzer, p. xxxv, note). Take the first book of the De Oratore
and· cp. ξ 20 etenim ex rerum cognitione efflorescat et redundet oportet
oratio with Dz'al. 30. 233 ξ 53 nisi qui naturas hominum vimque omnem
humanitatis . . . penitus perspexerit with 31. 103 ξ 72 artibus quae sunt
libero homine dignae . . . quibus ipsis, si in dicendo non utimur, tamen
apparet atque exstat utrum simus earum rerum rudes an didicerimus with
32. 4 ; § 32 arma quibus vel tectus ipse esse possis vel provocare improbos
vel te ulcisci lacessitus with 5. 283 ξ 31 quid enim est tam admirabile
quam ex infinita multitudine existere unum . . . with 6. Ι5; ξ 116 profiteri
se esse omnibus silentibus unum . . . with the same passage3 ξ 97 uti ei
qui audirent sic afficerentur animis ut eos affici vellet orator with 6. 173
and finally the definition of orator quoted from De Or. i. 15, 64 in ‘the
notes on 30. 26. Cp. also with 37. 14 His accedebat, &c., De Or. i. ξ 15
Excitabat eos magnitudo varietas multitudoque in omni genere causarum.
Reminiscences of the Brutus will be found at 30. 13 and 163 8. 15 ;

33. 13. But it is in the general fulness of the style of the Dialogue .

that the influence of Cicero's writings on its author may best be traced.
Such synonyms as the following (sometimes with a slightly different
shade of meaning) have a distinctly Ciceronian ring about them, and
have in fact been exactly paralleled by Weinkauff and others: animi
et ingenii, clamore plausuque, dzottzae et opes, sama et laus, vtis et facultas,
memoria et recordatio, modestia ac pudore, operae curaeque.

of Kleiber’s tractate (pp. 1—33), though of difference.
the next portion (pp. 33-70) is valuable
