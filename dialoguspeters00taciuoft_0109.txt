DIALOGUS DE ORATORIBUS. 5

rum cupiditate et quodam ardore iuvenili, ut fabulas quoque
eorum et disputationes et arcana semotae dictionis penitus ex-
ciperem, quamvis maligne plerique opinarentur nec Secundo
promptum esse sermonem et Aprum ingenio potius et vi naturae
quam institutione et litteris famam eloquentiae consecutum.
Nam et Secundo purus et pressus et, in quantum satis erat,

satisfactory to suppose that, in the arche·

type, the words in iudiciis utrosque were

accidentally omitted by the scribe, and

were written in above the line (quos ego
in iudiciis utrosque

non modo studiose audiebam), and
that subsequently in iudiciis was taken in
after ego and utrosque between non and
modo. Utrosque need not be suspected :
it serveS‚ coming aiter in iudiciis, to in·
dicate the separate activity of the two
pleaders (‘ the one as much as the other'):
they would not usually appear together.
It is common enough of a pair of indi-
viduals, e.g. Ann. xvi. 11, 11 illa utrosque
(patrem et aviam) intuens. For non modo
. . . sed quoque, which is classical, but rare.
Draeger (ξ 128) compares Hist. i. 57:
Liv. ix. 3, xxxvi. 35: Curtius: Gellius.

7. adsectabar. So Quintilian (in Plin.
Epp. ii. 14, 10) Adsectabar Domitium
Afrum.

8. fabulas. Their ordinary conversa-
tion, or casual talk (cp. 23. 11, 39. 4)
as opposed to set discussions (disputa-
tiones) on such questions as that which
forms the subject of the Dialogus. These
discussions they would no doubt hold
with others, as well as between themselves
when they met.

9. arcana. semotae dictionis. The
commentators generally refer this expres-
sion to the rehearsals (domesticae exercita-
tiones, Sen. Contr. i. praef. 12) with which
the rhetorician would favour his ‘cercle
intime' before any public appearance, in
order to have the benefit of advice and
criticism. But Church and Brodribb are
nearer the mark in rendering ‘ their private
and esoteric discourse :’ semotae sc. ab
auribus alienorum hominum, or a ratione
fori et iudiciorum. There is a touch of
the enthusiastic pupil in ‘ arcana,’ the
substantival use of which is common
enough in Tacitus: so ‘litterarum se-
creta‚’ Germ. xix. 3. For dictio, cp. 10.
31 fortuitae et subitae dictionis impetu.

penitus seems more appropriate in
such phrases as ‘ penitus infixum} Ann.

acciperem EV,.

ii. 76, 10: xv. 5, 8. Cp. however 30. 16
omnes philosophiae partes penitus hau-
sisse: Ann. ii. 12, 12 penitus noscendas
mentes. In Agr. xlv. 19 we have the fuller
expression ‘ Excepissemus certe mandata
vocesque, quas penitus animo figeremus.’

10. quamvis, with a subj. of fact, as
often also in Suetonius and later writers:
cp. Ann. i. 68: ii. 38: xi. 20: Hist. ii.
59, 79, 85: iv. 11 (Dr. ξ 201).

plerique, ‘ many,‘ ‘very many,’ as
often in Tacitus, and also in Quintilian
(ep. Introd. to Book x. p. xlvi). So 10.
26 and 26. 10: also (adjectivally) 17. 23
plerosque seneS, 31. 35. But in 26. 7
(plerique . . . actores) the meaning may
be ‘ most.' Many instances in Tacitus
are doubtful : G. and G. p. 1125. Cp. on
plerumque 6. 8.

nec . . . et, 4. 3; 33. 11.

11. promptus. Cp. JuV. iii. 74 sermo
promptus et Isaeo torrentim· : along with
prqfluens (as below) Ann. xiii. 3, 12 Au-
gusto prompta ac profluens . . . eloquentia

uit.

ingenio . . . institutione. Cp. the
antithesis impliedin ‘ingenium ac studium‘
14. 8 : also 19. 5 and 16. 3.

13. Nam explains maligne above, and
also the preceding eulogy of Aper and
Secundus.

purus . . . pressus. Plin. Ep. vii. 9,
8 ‘pressus sermo purusque! The same
qualities are indicated in Quint. x. 1. 94
‘ tersior ac purus magis ' (Horatius) : ep.
1. 9. 2 sermone puro et nihil se supra
modum extollente. For pressus (premo)
cp. Cic. de Or. ii. ξ 96 where ‘oratio
pressior' is opposed to ‘luxuries quae—
dam quae stilo depascenda est, ’ and below
18. 19 inflatus et tumens nec satis pressus
sed supra modum exsultans: see on Quint.
x. 1, 44.

in quantum for the more usual
quantum, as again at 41. 19: Anu. xiV.
47,2: xiii. 54‚5. So Ov. Met.xi. 71: Quint.
ii. 10, 4 (in quantum maxime potest), xi. 3,
118, ix. 4, 16, viii. 6, 24: Velleius, Seneca,
Pliny the Younger, and later writers.
