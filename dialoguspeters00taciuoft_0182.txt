78 CORNELII TA CITI

Iam vero propria et peculiaria huius urbis vitia paene in utero
10 matris concipi mihi videntur, histrionalis favor et gladiatorum
equorumque studia: quibus occupatus et obsessus animus quant-

ulum loci bonis artibus relinquit?

Quotum quemque invenies

qui domi quicquam aliud loquatur Ρ Quos alios adulescentulorum
sermones excipimuS, si quando auditoria intravimus? Ne prae-
15 ceptores quidem ullas crebriores cum auditoribus suis fabulas
habent3 colligunt enim discipulos non severitate disciplinae nec
ingenii experimentO, sed ambitione salutationum et inlecebris

adulationis

other contexts, the opposition between
suum and alienum is of material property:
Sall. Cat. v. 4 alieni adpetenS, sui pro-
fusus: cp. ibid. xii. 2 ε Tac. Hist. i. 4, 9:
Cic. de Or. i. ξ 173. So here John ⁸ want
of regard for what is one's own, as well
as for what belongs to others’: the ex-
planation being that, when a man loses
his sense of what is right, he will both
sacrifice what is his own and take what
does not belong to him in the reckless
pursuit of pleasure. But the other render-
ing supposes a construction into which
a writer like Tacitus might easily have
slipped. In any case there is no sufficient
ground for rejecting the whole expression
with Gudeman‚ as an interlinear gloss
supplied by a monkish scribe.

9. paene in utero. Cp. Cic. Tuse.
Disp. iii. 1 paene eum lacte nutricis erro·
rem suxisse videamur.

10. histrionalis favor = favor erga
histriones. For the adj. see on 26. 8 z cp.
Ann. i. 16, 10 histrionali studio: xiii. 25,
17 ludicram quoque licentiam et fautores
histrionum velut in proelia convertit im-
punitate et praemiis.

gladiatorum. The word is here used
by metonymy for ‘spectaculum gladia-
torum.’ So frequently in Tacitus ‘ gladia-
tores edere.'

11. equorum, ‘ horse-racing.’ For the
form which it took at Rome, see Plin.
Ep. ix‚ 6, and Professor Mayor's ex-
haustive notes on Juvenal xi. 197 sqq.

occupatus et obsessus animus.
Tacitus constantly uses such participles in
place of abstract verbal substantives or

invenies EV2CADH, invenires AB.

their equivalents, especially as the subject
of a verb, 37. 25.

12. Quotum quemque. See on Quint.
x. 1, 41. Mayor (1. c.) quotes the admoni-
tion of Epictetus, Man. 33 § 32, ‘ Speak
seldom, and in few words : when occasion
demands it, speak‚ but not on trivial
matters, not of sword plays, nor of horse
races, nor of athletes.'

14. Ne . . . quidem, as at 10. 1,
and 40. 14. The MSS. have nec . . .
quidem which some try to explain as =
ac ne . . . quidem (13. 1 and 24. 9): but
Helmreich is right in holding that nec is
a copyist's error, especially as the suggested
explanation cannot be applied to passages
like Ann. iv. 35, 8 quas nec (so M) victor
quidem abolevit3 xiv. 35, 7 (where see
Fumeaux), or Hist. i. 66, 2. So in
Agr. xviii. 31 B gives nec while A has

17. experimento = documento, as
often: Ann. xii. 6, 6 datum ab ea fecundi·
tatis experimentum.

ambitione, &c.‚ ‘ by interested visits
of ceremony and all the tricks oftoadyism.‘

30. 1. Transeo, more usually omitto
or praetereo. For the form of the sentence,
consisting of two independent clauses.
(instead of ut transeam in the first) cp.
Cic. pro Sest. 5 54, omitto gratulationeS,
epulas, partitionem aerarii . . . vexabatur
uxor mea, liberi ad necem quaerebantur:
de Sen. ξ 52.

discentium. See on praecipientium
28. 6. For these ‘ prima elementa,’ see
Quintilian’s first book.

et ipsis. In Tacitus, et ipse occurs
