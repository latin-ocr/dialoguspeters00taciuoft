Titus, in the year 81 A. D. His subsequent change of view was motived
hythe consideration that no one writing in the year 81, at so short an
interval after the conversation narrated in the Dialogue had taken place,
would have been likely to describe himself as having been then iuvenis
admodum: ‘so spricht Niemand von sich, der erst sieben oder acht
Jahre alter geworden ist.' Accordingly Nipperdey declared for the year
97 A. D., or thereby, as the date of composition. Accepting the argument
that the Dialogue could not have been written before the death of
Domitian, Professor Sauppe! drew from it the conclusion that
Tacitus could not possibly have been the author of a treatise of which
the style is so altogether different from that of the works which he is
known to have written towards the close of the first century A. D.

These views were combated by Steiner in one of the weightiest
contributions ever made to the settlement of the controversy 2. Steiner
' felt no difficulty in believing that Tacitus writing in, say his twenty-fifth
year (three years after his marriage with the daughter of Agricola, to
whom he tells us8 he had become betrothed, as z‘uvenzlr, in the year
77 A.D.), would have referred to himself as iuvenis admodum in describing
the circumstances of a literary debate to which he had listened when
probably only about eighteen years of age. At such a time of life an
interval of seven years, especially when so crowded with important
events, counts for much more than an equal interval in the life of an older
man. Steiner also dwells on the antecedent probability that a young
author who had devoted himself in his earlier years to the study of
eloquence would have taken the opportunity of embodying in a rhetorical
treatise like the Dialogue that lively sense of the contrast between past
and present, between the real and the ideal, which seems to have
been ever before the mind of the historian. After reviewing the other
conditions of the problem, and pointing out the impossibility, in the
light of the marked stylistic difference, of the view that the Dialogue was
written about the same time as the Germania and the Agricola, Steiner
concludes as follows4: ‘Da also sowohl die Lebensumstande der im
Dialogus austretenden Personen, als auch die Lebensumstande und
Studien des Tacitus selbst ganz wohl zu der Absassung des Dialogus unter
. Titus im J. 81 n. Ch. passen, und da, wenn der Dialogus in so friiher
Jugend geschrieben ist, auch der von den spatern historischen Werken
abweichende Stil, zumal bei der Verschiedenheit des Stoffes und der
dialogischen Form, sehr natiirlich und erklarlich ist 3 da endlich die ganze
