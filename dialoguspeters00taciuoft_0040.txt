Here Messalla's speech breaks off abruptly. The rest of it is lost in
a lacuna which the indications of the manuscripts enable us to infer²
must have originally contained about one-ninth part of the whole trea-
tise. The next speaker begins in the middle of a sentence, as Messalla
had left off. His identity will be discussed below, as well as the various
theories put forward by editors and critics as to the distribution of
parts in this last section of the Dz'aloguessz meanwhile the speech
may'be treated as forming (after the lost introduction) a continuous whole
(chs. 36-41).

Its main purpose is to emphasize the fact that the conditions of the
political constitution of the old free-state were more favourable for the
growth and development of eloquence: though it does not conclude with-
out a reference to the compensating advantages which are secured by
a more stable form of government. In the first place, eloquence was
a much larger factor then than it is now: like fire, it needs fuel to feed it,
and in those troublous times (illa perturbatione ac licentia) there was fuel
in abundance. This was the speaker's opportunity: a career was open
to him‘so long as power rested with the fickle populace, whose judgment
he could sway by his eloquence. We see now how distracting-it all was
to the country 3 but what else could have provided the orator with the
field he needs? Where else was he to look for such rich rewards?
Eloquence was, in fact, a necessary and indispensable passport to
public life. No one could get on without it. And the sphere of
oratory was far greater and more important then than now. Bribery at
elections, the pillaging of provinceS, the butchery of fellow-citizens—such

are referred to under their two main
heads, suasoriae and controversiae. The
former consisted of arguments for or
against coming to some resolution, and
were directed mainly to the cultivation
of the imaginative faculty. Persons and
situations were chosen from legend or
history, and, with some assistance from

slay Iphigenia. The controversiae were
more difficult, and involved a greater
amount of concrete legal argument. Their
subject matter was either altogether ficti-
tious (cp. quam incredibiliter compo·
sitae, 35. 16), or was made to depend
somehow or other on a historical occur—
rence or a question of present-day interest.
Thus criminal cases were often taken,
the students appearing both for the pro-
