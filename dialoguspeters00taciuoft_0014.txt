course of stu'dy. For this reason—especially in view of the comparative
poverty of Latin literature in such works—the Dz’alogue might have been
expected to win a place for itself in the curriculum of our higher schools
and Universities. Its substance is as valuable as its form is interesting
and attractive. It introduces us to a distinguished circle of public men
at Rome, who are represented as taking advantage of a more or less
accidental gathering to discuss questions of great interest and importance
for us as well as for themselves. Meeting together in the calm repose
which had resulted from the political settlement recently effected by the
founder of the Flavian dynasty, they bring under review past and present
circumstances in their bearing upon the profession in which they have all
more or less a common interest, the profession of oratory,—exchanging
opinions as to the merit and fame of the great orators of republican timeS,
as well as the divergent tendencies of the spirit of their own day, comparing
the main features of previous and contemporary methods of education,
and endeavouring to estimate the influence of political conditions on
the growth and prosperity of the art with which they are all connected.
All this gives the Dz'alogue a value of its own, independently of other
features of interest. It is moreover written in a natural, easy, and straight-
forward style, offering many points of contrast to that which we are
accustomed to associate with the literature of the epoch of which it is so

charming a survival.

THE QUEsTION OF AUTHORSHIP AND DATE.

Had there been any tradition in the Middle Ages that the historiari
Tacitus was the author of such a treatise as the Dialogue, there would
have been less ground for the scepticism which has so persistently pre-
vailed in regard to it, almost since the date of its re-discovery. But there
seems to have been none. The Humanists of the Renaissance searched
for many ancient writings which, though lurking concealed in neglected
corners, they knew must somewhere exist; and in their search they
stumbled upon others of which even the memory had passed away. One
of these was the Dz'alogue, which had corne down to them through the
unbroken quiet of the centuries without any literary notice to put them on
its track, a monks' treasure in regard to which one might almost imagine
there had been a conspiracy of silence.

It might have been expected that a work which had escaped the notice
of previous ages, and which, in the one and only manuscript to which we
