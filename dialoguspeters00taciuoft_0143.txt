DIALOGUS DE ORA TORIBUS. 3²9

‘Non enim’ inquit Aper ‘inauditum et indefensum saeculum
nostrum patiar hac vestra conspiratione damnari. , Sed hoc
primum interrogabO, quos vocetis antiquos, quam oratorum
aetatem significatione ista determinetis Ego enim curn audio
antiquos quosdam veteres et olim natos intelleg0, ac mihi
¹versantur ante oculos Ulixes ac Nestor, quorum aetas mille
fere et trecentis ann-is saeculum nostrum antecedit3 vos autem
Demosthenem et Hyperidem profertiS, quos satis constat Philippi
et Alexandri temporibus floruisse, ita tamen ut utrique super-
stites essent. Ex quo apparet non multo plures quam trecentos
annos interesse inter nostram et Demosthenis aetatem: quod
spatium temporis si ad infirmitatem corporum nostr-orum referaS,
fortasse longum videatur, si ad naturam saeculorum ac respectum

in proelium accingi: so 35, Ioin auxilium ;
66, 20 in audaciam, and frequently else·-
where.

14. inauditum et indefensum. The
same collocation occurs Ann. ii. 77, 9:
Hist. i. 6, 2 : and, inversely‚ Hist. ii. 10, 4.
F urneaux notes that inauditus is not
found, in this sense, before Tacitus, while
indefensus is used by Livy.

17. audio. See on auditos, 7. ad fin.

18. antiquos . . . veteres. As no
sufficient difference can be indicated by
the use of these words (which are found
together as synonyms 15. 1 and again at
the end of this chapter), Tacitus adds
to the latter the words et olim natos. In
Quintilian veteres and antiqui are both
frequently used in contradistinction to
novi, i. e. the writers of the post-Au-
gustan period. Cicero is included in the
former class, along with his predecessors ε
ix. 3, 1 omnes veteres et Cicero praecipue.

19. mille fere et trecentis annis. Era-
tosthenes and others placed the Trojan
War in 1193-1184, which will give 1268
or 1 269 years between the commencement
of the war and the date of the Dialogue

is doing his best to make out his case.
It is easy to show that as Demosthenes
died in 322 Β. C., at least 397 years must
have intervened between his ‘ aetas' and
the date of the Dialogue. But it suits
Aper’s argument to make the two periods
approximate as nearly as possible: hence
he emphasizes the fact that Demosthenes
survived Alexander, though he does not
mention that it was by only one year.
By starting his calculation from the date
of the deatlz of Demosthenes, and by
using nostra aetas loosely, for what we
know as the post—Augustan age, he is
able to finish with the words non mullo
plures quam trecentos annos interesse.
With quadringentos, which is substituted
by most editors for trecentos, there would
be little point in ‘ non multo plures quam.'
25. si . . . referas, i. e. if we take as
a standard of measurement our feeble
frames, and the brief span of our lives,
instead of the endless ages. Natura = the
real or actual constitution of the saecula.
