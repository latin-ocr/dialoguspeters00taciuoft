appearance on the last foli0‚ in a different hand, of two couplets on the
death of a dog, as follow :—

Parva zebor tibi parva domus es corpore parvus
Et brevis est tumulus et breve carmen habe.
Mapheus Vegetus.

Furum moeror heri spes quondam gone (?) catelle

Hic nunc spes furum moeror herique iaces.
L. A. 1462.

Maffeo Vegio we know as ‘the single instance of a poet-philologer who
assumed the cowl' (Symonds‚ Renaz'ssance, p. 517 ; Voigt, ii. p. 375).
Greater interest attaches to the identification of the initials attached to
the second couplet. It seems probable that they are those of the well-
known Leon Battista Alberti, one of the most remarkable figures in the
age of the Renaissance, and a man of the most varied accomplishmentS.
Alberti is known to have had a favourite dog, and on its death he
celebrated its praises in a piece of Latin entitled ‘Leonis Baptistae
Alberti canis ¹.' The occurrence of the couplet is of course no proof
that the volume belonged to Alberti: the initials may merely refer to him
as the author of the couplet, and the date may give the year in which he
composed it. At the same time, as both epitaphs are in a different
hand from that of the copyist, it is probable that they were added in
1462 to a manuscript that had been written a few years previously. The
writer may have intended them as a memorial of Tiptoft’s relationship
with Alberti, and of the interest he had taken in the dog which was thus
commemorated. The modesty of the initials L. Α., alongside of Vegio's
full name, might suggest an autograph: Alberti, after meeting Tiptoft in
Rome or elsewhere, may have sent the codex after him to England, with
the couplets attached ². He is known to have been in correspondence
with Enoch of Ascoli in 1451 (see Pozzetti, L. B. Alberti laudatus, 1789,
p. 15), and he probably kept himself informed of the results of the
monk’s search for manuscripts. On the other hand, supposing that
Tiptoft had ordered the codex before leaving Italy in 1460, the interval

of two years seems unnecessarily long.
Reference has been made already to another interesting feature in the
