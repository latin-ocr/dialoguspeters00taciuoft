he envies them not: freedmen are often as powerful as they, and they
have to pay the penalty of their position: nec imperantibus unquam satis
servi videntur nec nobis satis liberi.

Maternus concludes in a sort of ecstasy of inspiration (concitatus et
velut instinctus), and at this point (ch. 14) the company is re-inforced
by the entrance of Vipstanus Messalla. He apologizes for his intrusion;
but, on being reassured by SecunduS, expresses his gratification at finding ,
his friends interested in such discussions as that on which they had just
been engaged. Secundus he congratulates on his literary sympathies, and
Aper, more ironically, on his adherence to the topics of the schools, and
his exaltation of the methods and exercises of the new rhetoric over the
wider culture of the orators of old. This brings us to the real subject
of the treatise, the decadence of oratory, which Messalla says he often
'tn'es to explain to himself, and cannot believe that Aper means seriously
to deny. The two speeches of which the next part consists (16-27),
those of Aper and Messalla, turn on the comparative merits of Ciceronian
and contemporary eloquence. ⁴

Aper begins with a protest (16, 17) against the use of the term
antiqui. He refuses to admit that the orators of the late republic and
the early empire (Cicero, Caesar, Caelius, Calvus, Brutus, Asinius,
Messalla) are ancients at all. Both novi and antiqui may be said
to fall within the limits of a single life : in Britain he had himself seen an
old man who had fought against Caesar, and so might conceivably have
heard Cicero. The classical period, in fact, is not yet over. There is
no essentia} difference between ‘new' and ‘old¹,’ except in the minds
>of those who habitually disparage the present as compared with the past:
vitio malignitatis humanae vetera semper in laude, praesentia in fastidio.
Eloquence, like everything else, passes through stages of development ;
it is not tied down to one fashion of feature: mutantur cum temporibus
formae quoque et genera dicendi. Contemporary tendencies may be justified
by reference to an improved standard of taste and a developed culture.
It was not from lack of ability or ignorance that Cassius SeveruS, with
whom the decline is said to have begun‚ adopted his peculiar style: he set
himself deliberately (iudicio et intellectu) to effect a change that was called
for by an age which had now grown weary of the old dulness and want
of polish (tristem et impexam antiquitatem). The long and wearisome
