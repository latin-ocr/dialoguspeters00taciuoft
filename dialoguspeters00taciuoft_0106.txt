2 CORNELII TA CI TI

cipere (erit enim aut de ingeniis nostris male existimandum, si
idem adsequi non possumus, aut de iudiciis, si nolumus), vix
10 hercule auderem, si mihi mea sententia proferenda ac non disertis·

Ita non ingeniO, sed memoria et recordatione

opus est, ut quae a praestantissimis viris et excogitata subtiliter et
15 dicta graviter accepi, cum singuli diversas quidem sed probabiles

sit Lipsius and edd.

existimandum codd.: exist.

15. diversas quidem sed probabiles V2 (eas quidem Baehrens), diversas vel easdem
sed prob. most codd., diversas sed easdem prob. Roth, Andresen, John, Wolff, [vel easdem
sed prob] Halm, diversas rei eiusdem sed prob. J. H. Miiller, non easdem sed

probabiles Heller.

would have been onus susci-ure (Cic. de
Or. i. § 116: Quint. x. 2, 19): excipere
contains, however, the idea of taking the
‘ burden ’ over from Fabius,

8. &rit enim . . . existimandum. This
parenthesis (cp. 11. 3) is adopted in pre·
ference to the traditional reading, which
involves an awkward continuation of the
idea contained in tam magnae quaestionis
pondus. Erit (possibly est) may easily
have run into the preceding excipere,
whereupon the well-known contraction for
enim would be mistaken for a u (ut). Ι

o. iudiciis, ‘taste.' Cp. ‘auribus et
iudiciis,' 20. 20.

10. ae non, ‘instead of': Hist. i. 40,
8: Arm. vi. 2, 2.

11. ut nostris temporibus. This
restriction shows that, in the writer's
opinion, the unfavourable estimate of
contemporary eloquence implied in the
question addressed to him by Fabius
Iustus was not without foundation. Cp.
optimi et in quantum opus est diser-
tissimi viri‚ 41. 19.

repetendus. Cp. the frame-work of
Cicero's de Oratore, i. § 23 repetam . . .
ea quae quondam accepi in nostrorum
hominum eloquentissimorum et omni dig·
nitate principum disputatione esse versata.

12. iuvenis admodum. See Introd.
p. xv, From a comparison of other places
in Tacitus where this phrase is used (esp.
Agric. vii. 9: cp. Hist. ii.78‚ 93 iv. 5, 42), it
seems that it may be taken as meaning about
twenty years of age. So Quint. viii. 3, 31.

13. memoria retains, recordatio re-
calls: Cic. Brut. ξ 9: Tusc. v, ξ 88. See
Prof. Wilkins's note on ‘recordatione et
memoria} Cic. de Or. i. ς 228.

15. accepi. This verb is much more
frequently used of knowledge acquired by
tradition, or at second hand, than (like
excipere) of what is heard from the very
lips of a speaker. For the former cp.
accipere in 12. 18, 28. 23, 30. 8, 40.
13: for the latter excz'jbere, 2. 9, 15. 3,
29. 14: Agr. xlv. 19: Hist. iii. 85, 5.
But the comparison of such passages
as these is not a sufficient justification
of Gudeman’s proposal (Amer. Journ. of
Phil. vol. xii. p. 327) to alter the reading
of the MSS. to e praest. viris . . . excepi.
Against his belief in an invariable dis-
tinction between the two compounds„ it is
sufficient to quote Ann. i. 67, 2 dicta cum
silentio accipere: Hist. iii. 65, 1 haud-
quaquam erecto animo eas voces accipiebat.
In Cicero, too, we find ‘id, quod ipse
(sc. Pericles) ab Anaxagora, cuius auditor
fuerat, acceperat‚’ de Rep. 1 ς 25: and
even ‘ut Romae ex istius amieis acce·
peram,’ in Verr. ii. 4, 136.

singuli seems to refer only to those
interlocutors in the dialogue who admitted
the decline implied in the question with
which the treatise opens, though they had
different explanations to give of it: see
especially the speeches of Messalla (25-
35), and Maternus <36-42). Others think
that Aper also is included: but though
Aper knows the difference between ‘an-
cient' and ‘ modern ' oratory, he emphati-
cally denies the existence of any decline.
Aper is referred to (appropriately enough
after ‘disputationis ') in the sentence be-
ginning ‘Neque enim defuit qui’: the
whole context shows that, up to that
point, the writer is thinking only of those
interlocutors in the dialogue (probably
