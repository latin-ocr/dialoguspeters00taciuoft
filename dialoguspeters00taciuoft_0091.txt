Harleianus—the occurrence at the end of the Suetonius of a remarkable
note, in the hand of the copyist, Hic antiquissimum exemplar finit et lzoc
integrum videtur. Taken along with indications which go to show that
the original of H must have been a MS. abounding in contractionS‚ this
must be held to render it probable that it was no mere copy that Enoch
brought back with him to Italy, but his original ‘find ’—-the Hersfeld
codex—probably of the thirteenth century. If this inference is correct,
a lineal descent may be established for H from the archetype of Fulda.

Perhaps the most striking internal characteristic of H is its frequent
agreement with the hand in the Leidensis known as b (see p. lxx). If b
is as late as is generally supposed, the probability is that its readings were
derived from H, or from some similar copy executed about the same
time. For proof of this agreement, reference might be made to the
critical notes, but it may be instructive to exhibit here some of the
resemblances referred to, as well as some of the differences between
the two traditionS.

The following examples in which H and b agree are probably in
many cases the result of an independent attempt on the part of the
copyist of H to resolve the compendia in his original. The oldest editions
(Spirensis and Puteolanus) generally present the same readings :—-

5. 12 solicite for societate ; 5. 15 nationes for necessitudines; 5. 25 praesidio
for profugio ; 5. 26 irrepat for increpuit3 6. 18 quacunque for quemcum-
que3 7. 10 in codicillis for codicillis 3 8. 7 zpsa eloquentia om. H, del. b;
12. 14 ne aut illud clamore for nec ullis aut gloria maior; 25. 8 si quo minus
for in qua nimirum (?); 31. 31 civitatem for comitem (?) ; 33. 24 circa ora-
toriam (or ·um) for esse oratorum.

Other resemblances between H and b are :—

5. 11 arbitrium3 5. 12 sed et ipsum ; 6. 18 induxerz't3 10. 33 rightly lzinc

isti om. H, del. bC ; 29. 4 et virides om. H Put., del. b; invenies 29. 12.

On the other hand, H and b differ in the following places :—

7. 17 vetat H (Sp.)‚ notat b, vocat Put.; 8. 1 hunc Eprium b Put., here
proprium H ; 8. 11 haberemus H, habemus b; 8. 12 angustia ereptum H, an-
gustiae parentum b 3 10. 5 nedum b, metrum H (Sp. Put.) ; 15. 6 malignius
