DIALOGUS DE ORATORIBUS. 109

solitudine agitur. Oratori autem clamore plausuque opus est et
velut quodam theatr0; qualia cotidie antiquis oratoribus con-

tingebant, cum tot pariter ac tam nobiles forum coartarent, cum

clientelae quoque ac tribus et municipiorum etiam legationes ac
pars Italiae periclitantibus adsisteret, cum in plerisque iudiciis
crederet populus Romanus sua interesse quid iudicaretur. Satis
constat C. Cornelium et M. Scaurum et T. Milonem et L.
Bestiam et P. Vatinium concursu totius civitatis et accusatos et
defensos„ ut frigidissimos quoque oratores ipsa certantis populi
studia excitare et incendere potuerint. Itaque hercule eius modi
libri extant, ut ipsi quoque qui egerunt non aliis magis orationibus

censeantur.

14. elamore plausuque, as Hist. iii.
83, 2 clamore et plausu.

16. nobiles, sc. homines. The frequent
use of adjectives as nouns makes it un-
necessary to insert homines in the text,
with Orelli—On the other hand, Baehrens
and John supply ‘ oratores,’ out of anti-
quis . . . oratoribus immediately before,
and the latter translates ⁸ when the simul-
taneous appearance in the forum of so
many distinguished speakers occasioned
a real crowd! But does the writer not
mean that the needed stimulus was pro-
duced, in those times, by the crowded
forum, with the great men of the day, as
well as the multitude, for an audience‘?

18. pars Italiae . . . adsisteret. So
Ann. xiii. 4 ad fin. consulum tribunalibus
Italia et publicae provinciae adsisterent.

plerisque, ‘most,‘ as at 26. 7. See
on 2. 10.

20. C. Cornelium, tribune in 67, and
impeached by P. Cominius Spoletinus
in 65 on a charge of maiestas. He was
successfully defended by Cicero (Brut.
§ 271) in a speech which is no longer
extant. ·

M. Aemilius Scaurus was praetor in
Sardinia in 56, and when accused of
extortion was defended by six advocates,
one os whom was Cicero.

1.. Calpurnius Bestia was unsuccess-
fully defended by Cicero in 56 on a charge
of ambitus: ad Qu. Fr. ii. ξ 6 ‘ A. d. iii
Id. Febr. dixi pro Bestia de ambitu apud
praetorem Cn. Domitium in foro medio,
maximo conventu!

22. frigidissimos quoque=vel frigi-
dissimos. For this use of quoque, see
on 6. 19.

23. excitare et incendere. So often in
Cicero ‘ excitare et inflammare,' pro Leg.

eius modi . . . ut. It seems best to
take eius modi, with John, as predicative:
tr. ‘ Thus it is that the speeches that have
come down to us are of such a character
(i.e. so good) that those who delivered
them take rank by them more than by
any others’: they not only decided the
fate of the accused at the time, but they
may still be taken as unsurpassed per-
formances on the part of their authors.
Others separate eius modi from ut, render-
ing ‘Thus it is that speeches of this class
are still extant: those who delivered
them owe their fame to none more than
to these.’ To make this meaning clear,
Heller suggests et . . . censentur. But it
may be questioned whether ‘ libri ' does
not refer exclusively to the speeches just
mentioned.

24. egerunt. For this absolute nse,
cp. 18. 6: Quint. iii. 3, 16 (is qui agit),
xii. 9, 9, and frequently.

25. censeantur: aestimentur. Cp.
Agric. xlv. 4 una adhuc victoria Carus
Metius censebatur. The constr. is very
frequent in post-Classical Latin for ‘to
be appreciated,' ‘ distinguished’ for some-
thing, to ‘take rank by’ something:
Juv. viii. 2 longo sanguine censeri ε Suet.
