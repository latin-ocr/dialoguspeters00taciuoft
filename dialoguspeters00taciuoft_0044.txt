xxxii INTRODUCTION.

have forced itself on the notice of all interested observerS, as of great
moment not only in itself‚ but also in relation to the causes which had
brought it about. In the new condition of things introduced by the
establishment of the empire, eloquence had little room left it for exercise
and development. Its sphere had become narrowed and confined. The
forum was no longer the political centre of gravity. Debarred from
questions of importance, such as had afforded free scope for the oratory
of former days, the art of rhetoric now hid her diminished head in the
inferior law-courts‚ and in the unreal atmosphere of the schools of
declamation. Empty superficiality and mechanical routine usurped the
place of the power that had formerly swayed the hearts of men ε ut quae
olim omnium artium domina pulcherrimo comitatu pectora implebat, nunc
circumcisa et amputata, sine apparatu, sine honore, paene dixerim sine
ingenuitate, =quasi una ex sordidissimis artificiis discatur (32. 19). No
discussion of the causes of this decline could fail to take note of the
change in the public taste, of the altered conditions of education at
Rome, of the new political circumstances: and these are some of the
topics treated in the Dialogue.

As to the construction and plan of the work, the main difficulty hinges
on the great lacuna which occurs at the close of the thirty-fifth chapter,
and the distribution of parts in what follows. This must affect our
estimate of the part played in the debate (1) by Secundus, and (2) by
Maternus. There is less doubt about Messalla, and none at all about
Aper. Aper's attitude may be plainly enough inferred from the account
already given of the contents of the treatise. He is a realist and a utili-
tarian ¹, who has made his way by hard work at the bar, and who knows
both the value of the vposition he has achieved and the best methods o'f
securing it ². He speaks with the strong professional feeling of a man

¹ Nam si ad utilitatem vitae omnia derived no support from any extraneous
consilia factaque nostra derigenda sunt, accomplishments.' The passage is not¹

5. 18: cp. Quint. x. 7, 17.

² Attention has been called to the re-
semblance between Aper in the Dialogue
and Antonius in the De Oratore of
Cicero, especially in respect of their atti-
tude towards culture: cp. probabiliorem
hoc populo orationem fore censebat suam
si omnino didicisse numquam putaretur
(de Or. ii. ξ 4) with Aper omni erudi·
tione imbutus contemnebat potius literas
quam nesciebat, tamquam maiorem in-
dustriae et laboris gloriam habiturus si
ingenium eius nullis alienarum artium
adminiculis inniti videretur (Dial. 2.
14). Aper ‘ believed that he would
enhance the fame of his painstaking ap-
plication if people thought that his genius

free from difficulty, and some have asked
whether Aper would not have more natu-
rally desired to enhance his reputation
for natural ability rather than for ‘hard
work.' But there was no need for that:
even his* detractors aeknowledged his
natural endowments (2. 11 : ep. de Or. ii.
§1,0r. §143‚ of Antonius). They thought
that he possessed great natural ability,
but was deficient in training and culture.
Tacitus, his pupil, says he was not: on
the contrary, he was omni eruditione
imbutus. But at the same time he re·
presented, as a speaker, the tendencies of
the new rhetoric (14. 21). While pro-
fessing a sympathetie feeling for literature
(10. 13), he knew that, in practice, the
