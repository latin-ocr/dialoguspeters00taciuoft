xii INTRODUCTJON.
credit and reject it to point to any other author to whom the treatise may
be attributed with even a fair show of probability: the still unsolved
problem of the identity of the writer referred to, as a historian, by Quin-
tilian in the Tenth Book of his Institutio (1 ξ 104) is a sufficient reminder
of the gaps that exist in our knowledge of this as of many other periods
of literary history. But those who accept the testimony of the manuscripts
are at least entitled to ask whether the evidence which has accumulated
in favour of the authorship of Tacitus does not outweigh the counter-
arguments which must force those who adopt them into assuming the
existence of some unknown writer, who otherwise makes no appearance
in the literature of his own day.

Let us first examine the data on which it is possible to fix the year in
which the conversation narrated in the Dialogue purports to have taken
place. Unfortunately, the passages of the text from which these data are
derived are not free from a suspicion of doubt, but they furnish at least
approximate results. That a definite date was present in the mind of the
writer is evident from -17, 15, where he makes Aper sum up his chrono-
logical computation in the words centum et viginti anni ab interitu
Ciceronis in hunc diem colliguntur 1. If the speaker is to be taken
as meaning that exactly 120 years have elapsed since Cicero's murder,
the date of the dialogue would seem to be fixed for December 7, A. D. 78.
But a closer consideration of the constituent periods of which Aper's sum
total of 120 years is made up, as well as a comparison of the phrase
immediately preceding (sextam iam felicis huius principatus stationem
quo Vespasianus rem publicam fimet) will lead‘ to a different conclusion.
Whatever difficulties may be involved in the interpretation of the words
just quoted (see notes ad loc.) they seem undoubtedly to point to the sixth
year of Vespasian's reign. As the annals of Vespasian's principate were
made to date from July 1, 69, the day on which the solemn oath of
allegiance was taken to him at Alexandria ², his sixth year would run

¹ If the phrase in hunc diem occurred

in immediate juxtaposition with ab in·
only here, it would not be necessary to

teritu Ciceronis. When Messalla, a little

interpret it strictly: cp. the use of hodie.
But it is used again by Maternus on the
conclusion of Aper’s discourse <24 ad
fin.), in a clause which seems a rather
remarkable echo of what Aper had said,—
cum praesertim centum et viginti annos
ab interitu Ciceronis in hunc diem effici
ratio temporum collegerit. Unless these
words are the addition of some later
writer (the phraseology is noted as rather
peculiar) due weight must be given to the
repetition of the phrase in hunc diem

lower down (25. 4), states the interval of
time in a more general way (ante
centum annos), he is not taking the
death of Cicero as the starting-point of
a definite calculation, as Aper had done.
See what follows.
