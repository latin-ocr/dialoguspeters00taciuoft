DJALOGUS DE ORATORJBUS. 79

parum laboratur : necin auctoribus cognoscendis necin evolvenda
antiquitate nec in notitia vel rerum vel hominum vel temporum

satis operae insumitur.

most frequently in the nominative, · cp.
37.15 below, quae et ipsa plurimum
eloquentiae praestant, and for other in-
stances see Gerber ancl Greef, s. V. et,
pp. 399, 400. The ablative is found
Hist.· 1. 42, 1 Titum inde Vinium invasere· .
de quo et ipso ambigitur,- &c. In Livy,
et ipre is fre uently used, like ips-e quoque,
asa-naz αὐτ ς. No conclusive instance
can be cited from Cicero: see on Quin-
tilian x. 1, 31.

2. nee in, &c. After the ‘prima
elementa,’ the education of a Roman
youth was continued in ‘ grammatice ' or
‘litteratura’ (Quint. ii. 1, 4): and Mes-
salla’s complaint is that both these stages
were now prematurely displaced by a
barren and unreal training in the technical
rules of rhetoric.

auctoribus = scriptoribus. In the
Ciceronian age, auctor carried with it the
idea of ‘ authority,’ ‘warranty,' or the
like: see on Quint. x 1, 24. For
‘cognoscere auctoreS,’ cp. Quint. x. 5, 8.

evolvenda. antiquitate. Cic. de Or.
i. §18 tenenda praeterea est omnis anti-
quitas exemplorumque vis. While the
reading aud explanation of great writers,
especially poets, was the most important

function of the ‘grammaticus' (Quint. .

i. 4-9), instruction was also given in
history (Cic. de Or. i. ξ 187; Quint. i. 2,

1,4 · cp. x. 1, 34 with the notes), as well
as in the elements of science and philo-
sophy,—physics‚ logie, and ethics (Quint.
i. 4, 4). thus Quintilian says of‘ gram-
matice’ in ii. 1, 4 ‘tenuis a fonte ad·
sumptis poetarum historicorumque viribus
pleno iam satis alveo fluit, cum praeter
rationem recte loquendi non parum alio-
qui copiosam prope omnium maximarum
artium scientiam amplexa sit!

3. rerum, ‘departments of knowledge '
(cp. omnium rerum scientia, below):
hominum, ⁴ human nature,’ ‘ character ἐ
temporum, ‘ circumstances) Concrete
conditions‚ Messalla means, are not
sufficiently studied: their place is taken
by ‘fictae et nullo modo ad veritatem
accedentes controversiae ’ (31. 3). That
this is the meaning seems to me to be
evident from a comparison of the defini-

tion with which the chapter concludes,
where we have again ‘ rerum‚’ ‘temporum '
and ’ ‘audientium. The necessity for a
knowledge of character (‘hominum no-
titia,’ cp. nisi qui cognovit naturam
humanam, 31. 1 Ι) and for a due apprecia-
tion of the effect which different situations
are likely to produce upon the feelings of
an audience (⁶ temporum notitia ²), is
enlarged on in the next chapter: see esp.
‘ sive apud infestos sive apud cupidos . . .
dicendum habuerit‚’ &c., and cp. Cic.
Or. ξ 123 sit temporum personarumque
moderator, nam nec semper nec apud
omnes . . . eodem modo dicendum ar-
bitron—John, however, gives a very
different interpretation, which is sufficiently
ingenious to merit special notice. He
thinks that, just as ‘antiquitas' in the
text refers to ‘history and antiquities,’ so
‘res' denotes physics (including astro-
nomy), as in‘ rerum motus causasque‚' in
line 22, below: while by ‘homines' he
understands ethics and psychology (31. 4),
and by ‘ tempora 'a knowledge of political
theory. The last branch would cor-
respond to Cicero's ‘prudentia iuris
publici‚' de Or. i. §§301, 256, or ‘rerum
civilium cognitio et prudentia‚’ ib. i. §602
cp. also ib. i. ἐξ 159, 165, 48: iii. ἐξ 72,
76. This would leave only dialectics or
logic without special reference in the
enumeration of the functions of the ‘ gram-
maticusss
ῑηῒρηῗέἓῖᾞῖἓέἶ 4, ¹2¹3P³ssss¹ffffi0oesuiuzlfiss
with the dative, as Ann. iii. 44, 7 libel-
lis accusatorum insumeret operam, and
ch. 9. 1, above, quibus totam vitam
Maternus insumere optat. It is not
necessary to read ‘ in notitiam,’ with
Baehrens: in with the ablative denotes
‘ the sphere in which.’

Sed, after a negative clause, ‘ No’; cp.
ἀλλά. They spend too little time on
preparatory training: the ‘rhetor' is
prematurely called in.

quos rhetoras vocant ε cp. 85. 2 isto·
rum qui rhetores vocantur. So Crassus in
de Or. i. ξ 52 ipsi magistri qui rhetorici
vocantur: iii. ξ 54 horum qui nunc ita
appellantur rhetorum.
