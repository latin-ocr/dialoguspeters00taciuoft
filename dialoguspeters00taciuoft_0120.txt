pressions of modesty, cp. Cic. pro Arch.
ξ 13 facultas quantacumque in me est.

5. reum . . . defendere. This refers
to criminal processes, which might be in—
stituted either in the ordinary iudicia, for
the general body of the citizens, or in
the senate for members of the senatorial
order, ‘as also for offences against the
emperor or the state, malversation in the
provinces, &c. The similar enumeration
‘sive in iudicio sive in senatu sive apud
principe1n,' 5. 29 would seem to justify
the insertion, with most edd„ of ‘apud
patres': but it is possible to carry
parallelism too far.

6. apud centumviros. This court
was specially charged with the decision
of questions by law involved in such
matters as inheritance‚ wardship, &c.
From ch. 38. 1 1 (causae centumvirales quae
nunc primum obtinent locum), it is clear
that its functions were of great importance.
Originally it consisted of 105 members,
three being chosen out of each of the thirty-
five tribes: at a later time it was sub-
divided, and the membership rose to 180.
See Wilkins’ note on Cic. de Or. i. ξ 173.

7. apud principem. The emperor’s
cabinet-council (consilium) took special
cognisance of all actions raised against
officials of the government.

ipsos illos libertos et procuratores
principum. It was from the ranks of
the imperial freedmen that the ‘pro—
curatores ' were for the most part chosen.
The word denotes all the emperor’s
agents who had charge -of finaneial
matters either at Rome or in the im—
perial provinces. For the great power
wielded by these freedmen‚ cp. 13. 16
tantum posse liberti solent: it is pointed
to in the {fisos illos. See also F ried·
l'ander, p. 82 sqq.

10. [cum] Acidalius‚ civium Baehrens.

8. tueri et defendere. So ‘tueri
atque defendere,' Cic. de Or. i. ξ 172:
ad Fam. xiii. 64, 1 : Tac. Germ. xiv. 4
illum defendere, tueri. Defendere implies
defence from actual attack : tueri protec-
tion from a possible danger.

datur. As in Vergil and Ovid, dare
is often fonnd in Tacitus, Quintilian, and
Pliny with an infinitive. Cp. Ann. iii.
67, 10: iv. 6, 5, &c. Dr. ς 145.

10. in animo. This passage has been
much discussed, and variously emended.
In aliquo could not stand: we should
rather have expected in ipso. In alvo
(Pithoeus) seems to me to be quite
untenable. I had thought of ‘si non
innatum oritur,' which Steiner also sug·
gested: or ‘si non nativum' (cp. the
antithesis between nativum and ascitum
Nep. Att. iv. 1). On the whole, the
reading in the text is the safest: the con-
tractions for alio, which is found in all
MSS„ and animo are so similar that con·
fusion may easily have arisen. [Buchholz
supports his conjecture (see above) by
assuming that a reference to money (cp.
6. 8) is infflspensable, and by the paral-
lelism that results: for metallo, he com-
pares Hor. Ep. i. 10, 39. Heller (Philo-
logus, 1892, p. 346) desiderates nisi for si
non on the ordinary readings. Si non
in caelo oritur he puts forward as a hit
at the poets, who considered inspiration
their special prerogative (cp. the use of
vates, 9. 9). Aper means ‘ I won't go
the length of saying that it is the gift of
heaven, but it is a gift which neither
prince nor people can bestow.‘]
