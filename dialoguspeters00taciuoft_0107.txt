DIALOG'US DE ORA T ORIBUS. 3

causas adferrent, dum formam sui quisque et animi et ingenii
redderent, isdem nunc numeris isdemque rationibus persequar,

servato ordine disputationis

Neque enim defuit qui diversam

quoque partem susciperet, ac multum vexata et inrisa vetustate
nostrorum temporum eloquentiam antiquorum ingeniis anteferret.

including Secundus) who took the same
ground as Fabius did in his question.

15. diversas quidem sed probabiles.
On this reading, vel easdem is rejected as
a gloss added by some one who wished
to indicate that the arguments advanced
by the different speakers are identical.
This is true only so sar as they agree
in admitting the fact of the decline im-

lied in the question of Fabius justus.

cum . . . dum. For the dependence
of the latter on the former, though in
a rather different construction, cp. Ann.
xii. 68, 2 cum . . . obtegeretur, dum . . .

motived by the mood of the foregoing
subordinate clause.

might be supported from Germ. xvi. 53

20. antiquorum ingeniis. Antiquis,
by itself, would have been quite a
usual metonymy: cp. Cic. de Or. ii. ξ 4
nostrorum hominum prudentiam Graecis
(i. e. Graecorum prudentiae) anteferre.
There is a real antithesis (not, as here, one
motived merely by the wish for symmetry)
in Agr. xxi. 7 ingenia Britannorum studiis
Gallorum anteferre.

Curiatius Maternus is known to us
only through this treatise. He has now
abandoned the profession of rhetoric, and
is devoting himself to the composition
of tragedies, four of which are named,
Medea, Thyestes, Domitius, Cato. From
the allusion in the text (cp. 11. 19), many
have been led to infer that he is identical
with the Μάτερνος σοφιστής who was put
to death by Domitian in 91 for too great
freedom of speech (Dion Cass. lxvii. 12).
See however Introd. p. xxxvii.

Catonem. The praise of Cato of Utica
was traditional at Rome from the day of
his death. Cicero wrote a ‘Cato' (ad Att.
xiii. 46, 2: Tac. Ann. iv. 34, 20: Gell. xiii.
19), to which Caesar replied in an ‘ Anti-
cato' (Plut. Caes. liv. 733 : Gell. iv. 16),
consisting of two books (Suet. Iul. lvi.:
Juv. vi. 338) in the form of speeches
(‘ rescripta oratione velut apud iudices re-
spondit,' Ann.l. c.). C . Hor. Od. i. 12,

i. 128 ‘victrix causa deis placuit, sed victa
