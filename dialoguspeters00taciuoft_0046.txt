great rhetorician’s review of literature. The probability is that, like
SecunduS, he did not live to attain to the maturity of his powers.

Aper's chief opponent is Vipstanus Messalla, who is known to us from
the Hz'storzies as an energetic supporter of Vespasian against Vitellius ¹.
Messalla is as enthusiastic for the past as Aper is for the present. He
has no sympathy with the emptiness and unreality of the education which
was provided in his day, and his instincts 'as a true—born Roman (the
only one, by the way, of all the disputants) lead him to dwell fondly on
the great orators of the past and the causes to which they owed their
greatness. To him they realize, far more than any contemporary speaker,
the ideal of what an orator ought to be. He saw that the modern
specialization of the studium, and its absorption in the technicalities and
trivialities of the schools of rhetoric rendered impossible the acquisition
of that broad culture and those wide interests which had been the glory
of Cicero and his contemporaries. It is this that leads him to declaim
against the views which Aper represents with an intensity of conviction
and a vigour of language sor which he feels impelled half playfully to
apologize <32 ad fin.). He refers contemptuously to the ‘so-called
rhetoricians ’ (expetuntur quos rhetoras vocant, 30. 5) whose premature
activity displaced from the education of the Roman youth broader and
more valuable studies, such as history and philosophy, and robbed it of
the sound foundation on which it had formerly rested. His speech is
unfortunately lost just as he is beginning to emphasize the existing
divorce of the, schools from practical life by picturing the discomfiture of
the aspirant to oratorical renown when he is first transferred from the
technicalities of the lecture-soom to the realities of the forum. Though
a ‘ laudator temporis acti' Messalla was himself no recluse, but a man of
action. He had taken an active part in the campaign* against Vitellius,
and Tacitus was indebted to him for an account of some of its incidents
(Hzlrt. iii. 25, 28). His own reputation for eloquence stood high, and
Aper, in the Dz'alogue, makes a complimentary reference to the occasion
when he had gained great fame at Rome by pleading the cause of his
less worthy brother, Aquilius Regulus, before the Senate (ch. 15). This
was in A.D. 70 (Hz'st. iv. 42). Messalla must of course have been alive four
or five years later, when the dialogue is said to have taken place; but as
he is not mentioned in Pliny’s Letters (where allusions to Regulus are
frequent) it has been‘ inferred that he too died young. In fact, it may
