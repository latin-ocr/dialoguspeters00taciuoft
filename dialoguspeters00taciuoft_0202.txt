36. *²¹5 ’κ rem cogitant. Nihil humile vel abiectum eloqui,
poterat. Magna eloquentia, sicut flamma, materia alitur et
motibus excitatur et urendo clarescit. Eadem ratio in nostra,
quoque civitate antiquorum eloquentiam provexit. Nam etsi

posita et quieta et beata re publica tribui fas erat, tamen illa.
perturbatione ac licentia plura sibi adsequi videbantur, cum,
mixtis omnibus et moderatore uno carentibus, tantum quisque
orator saperet quantum erranti populo persuadere poterat.

Ghs. 36—41. Speeclz of Maternus, con-
necting tlte decline eff eloquence with
external condziions, in respect of which
tlte age of the republic was more favourable
to its growth: and reviewing the com-
pensating· advantages qf contemporary
circumstances.

36. 1. humile . . . abiectum, often
conjoined by Cicero: de Fin. V. ξ 57
nihil abiectum, nihil humile cogitant: Or .
ξ 192 humilem et abiectam orationem.

2. Magna eloquentia. This is the
passage in connexion with which William
Pitt is recorded to have proved his ready
skill at off-hand translation. Some one
having pronounced it untranslateable, he
came out with the following : ‘ It is with
eloquence as with a flame. It requires
fuel to seed it, motion to excite it, and it
brightens as it burns ' (Stanhope's Life of
Pitt, vol. iii. p. 413). Cp. Cic. Brut. §93
omnis illa vis et quasi flamma exstin—
ruitur.
ἑῇ 3. motibus The use of the plural
seems to favour John's explanation that
the reference is, in the case of eloquence,
to political disturbances (cp. illa pertur-
batione, below) ε in the case of fire, it will
be rather to deliberate stirring and poking,
than to the fanning of fitful breezes. The
commentators generally explain ‘motus ' of
mental excitement, comparing the Brutus
l. c. (of Galba) ‘ dein cum otiosus (i. e. in
the calm that followed his outburst of
feeling) stilum prehenderat motusque
omnis animi tanquam ventus hominem
defecerat, flaccescebat oratio.’

clarescit. This verb is more corn-
monly used metaphorically, eg. Ann.
xi. 16, 13 (of becoming famous): cp.
however Ann. xv. 37, 13 quantum iuxta

nemoris . . . luminibus clarescere. Gude-
man would substitute (with Maehly)
calescit for clarescit, on the ground that
the latter word is an ‘intolerable tauto-
logy,'—only another expression for what
is already contained in motibus excitatur:
‘ it is fanned into a flame by breezes, and
waxes warm in the buming.' He com-
pares 22. 12 tarde commovetur, raro in-
calescit, and also the frequent collocation
‘excitare et inflammare ' (e. g. Cic. pro
Pomp. 2: de Harusp. resp. 1, 19). But
this is altogether unnecessary: Pitt's ‘it
briggtens as it burns ’ may be allowed to
stan .

Eadem ratio, ‘the same conditions!
From in nostra quoque civitate, we may
infer that the speaker has been treating of
Greek eloquence,—probably of the golden
age of Attie oratory.

5. composita . . . re publiea: ‘under
a settled, peaceable, and prosperons con-
stitution.' Cp. 41. 2 non emendata neque
usque ad votum composita civitas: Anu.
iv, 1, 2 and passim.

quae . . . tribui fas erat, i.e. every·
thing that could be legitimately accorded
or secured to them—everything, therefore,
that could be reasonably looked for—-
gonsistently with a settled political con-

ition.

7. videbantur, sc. antiqui oratores, as θ
is evident from the antithesis between
lzorum . . . temporum and illa perturba-
batione. There is an emphasis on sibi,
which goes with adsequi: ‘the personal
advantages which they saw open to them
were greater then than now.’

gatis iam omnibus: cp. Hist. i. 68, 13
dirutis omnibus. Tr. ‘ When in the
