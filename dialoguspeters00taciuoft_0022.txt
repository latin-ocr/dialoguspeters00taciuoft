x INTRODUCTION.

geistige Richtung und Weltanschauung des Tacitus mit dem Inhalte und
der Tendenz des Dialogus recht gut fibereinstimmt: so miissen wir den
Handschriften, den ‘altesten Ausgaben und sonstigen Zeugnissen zufolge
den Tacitus, und nur den Tacitus, als Verfasser des Dialogus anerkennen.'

Attention was now (1868) called by Professor Edward Wolfflin to the
fact that the peculiar and highly individual style with which the name of
Tacitus is identified was the result of development and growth ¹. Wolfflin
protested against the habit of regarding the historian's style and diction
as a constant whole, instead of as a progressive feature which he developed
through various stages until its highest expression was reached in his
latest work, the Annals. Applying this principle of a stylistic ‘ genesis'
to the Dz'alogue, Wolfflin sought to demonstrate that there are connecting
links which, in spite of an interval of some twenty years, enable the critic
to establish identity of authorship with the earliest historical writings of
Tacitus, His argument derived support from the appearance, in the same
year, of the first edition of Draeger's well-known work Ueber die Syntax
und den Stil des Tacitus. It might have been expected now that the
controversy would have been regarded as, on the whole, settled in favour
of the vindicators of Tacitus 3 but in publishing the edition of the Dz‘alogue
which is perhaps the most widely used at the present time, Dr. Georg
Andresen took the opportunity of ranging himself alongside of the
opponents of the traditional view. Andresen agrees with those critics who
consider it impossible that the Dz’alogue can have been written before the
reign of Domitian. If it had been an early work of Tacitus, composed
under Titus, he would surely have referred to the conversation out of which
it resulted as having taken place paucos abhinc annos rather than when
he was a very young man (iuvenis admodum). Andresen doubts, more-
over, whether so young an author as Tacitus was in the reign of Titus
would have been intellectually ripe for the treatment of such topics as
those dealt with in the Dz'alogue: also whether Fabius Justus, the
intimate friend of the younger Pliny, and probably no older than he,
would have been likely in the year 74—75 A. D. (when Pliny, at least, is
known to have been only thirteen years of age) to attack‚ along with the
youthful Tacitus, the deep-lying problem of the causes of the decline of
eloquence. Further, he considers it barely credible that the allusions to
Eprius Marcellus and Vibius Crispus (chs. 8 and 13) would have been
risked while they were still alive: and though the former died in 79, the
latter is known to have flourished at the court of Domitian and to have
died, at an advanced old age, shortly before the year 93. Andresen
