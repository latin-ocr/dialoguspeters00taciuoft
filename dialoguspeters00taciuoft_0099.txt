MA N US CRI P TS. lxxxvii

35. 21 must be classed as doubtful (prosequantur X, persequantur Y)
though Ι have adopted what seems to have been the reading of X.

In what may be considered minor matters of orthography‚ the
advantage is sometimes on the one side, sometimes on the other, e. g. :—

6. 1 iocunditas EV2CA‚ iucunditas H iocunditatis A, iucunditatis B
10. 16 elegorum ECAD H, elegorum V2 elegiarum AB
26. 23 deminuta HV2CAD, diminuta AE dimunuta B
30. 2 auctoribus EV2CADH autoribus AB

15. 16 concentus ABE (for concentu) concentus V2CADH

17. 9 statue ABE statuae V2CAD, statug H

19. 2 alte AB altae V2CAD‚ alte H

32. 22 ut quae ABDH utque EV2CA

39. 5 tabularia ABDH tabulariae V2C‚ tabularig E,
fabulari? Δ

39. 9 ipsam ABDH ipffl EV2CAD

Doubtful are 10. 21 where EV2CA give artes and ABDH artis 3 and
22. 18 where supellectile has sully as good MS. authority (ABEV2H) as the

' · more correct form supellectili CAD.

 

In the following doubtful places the true reading is established by the
agreement of ABEV2 as against CAD: H supports the former in the two
first instanceS, the latter in the third ;-

ABEV2 C ΔΙ)
15. 17 aut Asinio aut ab Asinio
22. 23 fugitet ABEV2A fugiet CD
37. 17 expilatis de expilatis
33. 8 ingressuri ingressi DHV, ingraessi C Δ

The following is doubtful ε
17. 28 vocetis ABEV2H vocitetis CAD

The probability here is that the reading vocetis is due to the neglect of
a mark of abbreviation: the position is reversed at 22. 23 where fugitet
(ABEV2A) is right as against fugiet (CD). Cp. 25. 4 where the X family
seems right with constat (ABDH) as against constaret (ECA). On the
other hand it might of course be argued that the superiority of the vocetis
tradition points to the unnecessary insertion of a supposed omitted
syllable it in CDA. The latter are often wrong where ABEV2 are right
(Scheuer‚ pp. 23, 24) ; though the following must be placed to their
credit :—

33. 10 arte et scientia C AD arte et inscientia ABEV2H
37. 11 Metellos et CADH (so b) Metellos sed et ABEV2

The foregoing lists do not include some striking variations as regards
