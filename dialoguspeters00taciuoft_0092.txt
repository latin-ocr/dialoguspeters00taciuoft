Put. (and where sunt seems, by the way, not to be indispensable to the
context); 21. 17 et H, for regule AB, which is deleted by b;
23. 2 sensu is left blank in H, sus Sp„ secundus V, serus Put. (cp. 23. 21
summum HSp. for sensuum) ; 28. 3 no HSp. Put. for nominis con-
troversiam 3 cp. 13. 3 where the insertion of controversiae by H after pericula
sua et suggests either that the true reading may be ‘ certamina et pericula sua
et controversiae ad consulatus evexerint ⁹ or else that the reading of H is due

to the misinterpretation of a compendium, such as centi evexer‘. Similarly “

in the Suetonius 102. 3, 12 Πανὸς ἀγάπημα which is variously rendered in
other codd., is lest a mere blank in H, introduced by a tentative p.

The remarkable agreement of H with the early printed editions may
be made the subject of a separate paragraph, as showing the influence
which the copyist exerted on the early constitution of the text. H has
been shown to be of earlier date than 1470, the year in which the editio
princeps appeared ; if it was conveyed to England some eight or nine
years previously, it may have been used, before being sent off, to com-
plete, as regards the Dialogue, some manuscript of the family to which
the Vindobonensis (V) belongs, and from which Spira is believed to have
printed his text. The following are instances of mistakes in H, generally
shared by V, and perpetuated in the early editions, omissions are indi-
cated by square brackets. It will be noticed that many of the readings

are due to misinterpretation of compendia: —.
