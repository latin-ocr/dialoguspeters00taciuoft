a more or less exact transcript of his original: the copyist of Y, on the
other hand, brought greater scholarship to bear on his task, and allowed
himself more freedom in executing it. The X family is represented
now by the Vaticanus 1862 (A) and the Leidensz‘s (Β). The Y family
includes the Farnesianus (C), Vaticanus 1518 (D), Vaticanus 4498 (Δ),
the ottobonianus (Ε), the Vindobonensis necin (ΥΞ), the Harlcianus (H),

and the Vindobonensis eccm (V) ¹.
The editio princeps of the works of Tacitus, which did not include the

as yet undiscovered first six books of the Annals, is understood to have
been printed from a codex which must have derived ultimately from the
manuscript now known as the Second Medicean (Laur. 68, 2), generally
believed to have been written at Monte Casino in the latter half of the
eleventh century. It was published by Vendelin de Spira at Venice in
1470. Several MSS. of the last books of the Annals and the Historiis
must then have been available‚ some of them copied, no doubt, as soon
as the Second Medicean had passed, at the time of N iccolo’s death (1437),
from private keeping into the library of the Convent of St. Mark, after-
wards ‘incorporated with the Laurentian Library at Florence. But none of
them contained the minor works2. For these Spira must have been
indebted to some copy of Enoch's find, by which the Germania and the
Dialogue‚ at least, were re-united to the parent stem from which they had
so long been dissevered. Such codices as the Farnesianus (C) and the
Vindobonensis (V) must have resulted from the wish to combine Enoch's
discovery with the already known works. It was from a codex of this
class (said to have been at the time in the Library of St. Mark at Venice)
that Spira printed: as far as concerns the Dialogue, it must have embodied
many of the readings and emendations of which the earliest trace is
probably to be found in the hitherto neglected Har‘leianus (H). Then
came the edition of Puteolanus (Milan, 1475), in which many of the
mistakes of the editio princeps were corrected. Puteolanus is generally
understood not to have had the assistance of any manuscript (Michaelis,
