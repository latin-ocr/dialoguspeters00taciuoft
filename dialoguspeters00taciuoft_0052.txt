the thoughts that were in the mind of its author, and it is in the recon-
ciliation, in him, of opposing tendencieS, that the unity of the piece is
to be sought for. There is thus an essential relationship between the
first part of the treatise (chs, 1-13), which is often described as merely
introductory, and the last ¹. In the former, Maternus justifies his pre·- ’
ference for poetry by the contention that forensic oratory, even in its
most perfect type, is nothing but an inferior development, due to the
loss of primitive innocence‚ of the form in which eloquence dwelt with
men in the golden age, viz. poetry: haec eloquentiae primordia, haec
penetralia ,· lzoc primum habitu cultuque commoda mortalibus in illa casta
et nullis contacta vitiis pectora influxit ,· sic oracula loquebantur, 12. 6.
In the latter his retirement from the profession of an advocate is
explained by reference to the narrower limits within which eloquence
now moveS, as compared with the days of old. In both his speecheS,
Maternus sighs for quiet retirement: compare such expressions as
inquieta et anxia oratorum vita, with its certamina and pericula, and the
insanum et lubricum fhrum, in the first, with the repeated statement in
the second, non de otiosa e't quieta re loquimur et quae probitate et modestia
gaudeat.

settlement. Men's memories must have
been full of the horrors of N ero’s reign,
and of the longus et unus annus that
had seen three emperors come and go:
on the other hand they could see for

dangers, by finding a road midway inter
abruptam contumaciam et deforme obse-
quium (Ann. iv, 20). Men who had
succeeded in this, moderate liberals who
reckoned with the established order, and

 

themselves what had been accomplished
by the hard-working and conscientious
⁶ citizen-emperor,‘ Vespasian. Tacitus no
doubt looked back with regret on the
days of the old free-state: the republican
form of govemment was, in his vieW, the
most favourable to freedom (Ann. vi. 42).
But he knew that conditions had alto·
gether changed, and that the monarchy
had now become necessary for peace and
for the maintenance of the huge fabric of
the empire (cp. Hist. i. 1, 53 ii. 383 i. 16).
The summary of the historian's political
convictions given by Teuffel-Schwabe
(§ 333, 8) may be reproduced here, as ap-
plicable to Maternus as well as to Tacitus·
‘Accordingly—the republic having be-
come impossible and the monarchy neces-

74), and attempt to steer his course
through these difficult circumstances so
as neither to sacrifice his honour out-
wardly nor expose himself to serious

freedom (modum et temperamentum ad-

therefore fully appreciated by Tacitus:
e. g. Μ’. Lepidus (Ann. iv. 20,.vi. 27),
L'. Piso (Ann. vi. 10), C. Cassius· (Anu.
But such men as Helvidius, Priscus (Hist.
iv. 6), and Paetus Thrasea (Ann, xiv. 12),
are not after his heart.’

that Mammas, in this last speech, is re-
ferring to some of the points which Aper
had tried to make in their introductory
discussion. Thus 36. 20 ‘ln‘ clientelis
etiam exterarum nationum redundabant*
may be a rejoinder to what Aper had
stated 3 ad fin.‘ cum te tot coloniarum
