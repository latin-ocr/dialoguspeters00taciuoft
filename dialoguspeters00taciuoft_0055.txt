clarescit (36. 2)². In chs. 36 and 37 his main point is clearly and
distinctly stated. Just as afterwards in chs. 40 and 41 the supe-
riority of republican eloquence is fully recognized (40. 8 magna illa et
notabilis eloquentia . . . tulit sine dubio valentiorem eloquentiam; 41. 22
summa illa laus et gloria in eloquentia: cp. 37. 3), so in these opening
chapters (as also in ch. 38) the speaker sets forth clearly the disad-
vantages that were bound up with a state of things favourable to the
production of great orators: illa perturbatione ac licentia . . . mixtis
omnibus et moderatore uno carentibus . . . turbidis et inquietis temporibus.
Nothing of this need be taken as censure; the speaker knows the differ-
ence between peace and war (37. 32), and can appreciate the former
without failing to recognize that the latter is the best training-school of
soldiers. But, unlike Messalla, Maternus does not believe that a return
of such political conditions is either practicable or desirable. It may
be impossible now to realize again the magna et notabilis eloquentia that
was the glory of the republic, and for which she paid so high a price
(36. 14 ς 40. 25). Things have altogether changed. Orators are of less
consequence now than they used to be, and eloquence has to content
herself with a contracted sphere (cp. omissis forensium causarum angus-
tizs, 4. 8). But Maternus can at least console himself by utilizing the
advantages of his own peaceful times, and devoting himself to the
pursuits of a learned leisure (cp. 4 ad fin. sanctiorem illam et augus-
tiorem eloquentiam colam). High oratorical renown and settled repose are
incompatible with each other: therefore while recognizing the superiority
of the eloquence which was nurtured on the disorder of former times, let
every one be thankful for peace and quietness—and make the best use
he can of his talents and opportunitieS.

STYLE AND LANGUAGE.

Tua importance of a consideration of the language and style of the
Dialogue, as bearing on the problem of its authorship, has been indicated
in the introductory Section. Its obvious want of resemblance to the
style of the Annals was the first ground on which Lipsius and his

his frequent use of the figure Anaphora pitched in a lofty key, as was that of
(see p. lix), as well as the rhetorical Maternus.
