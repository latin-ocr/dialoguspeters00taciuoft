similarity between the criticisms pronounced on individual orators in the
Dz'alogue and those which occur from time to time in the historical books,
Further, the whole tone of the Dialogue, and the features which reveal
the mental attitude of its author, were declared by Lange to be in entire
harmony and correspondence with what we know of Tacitus from his
other works-the familiar habit of psychological reflection, the tendency
to dwell regretfully on the comparison of the present with the past, the
grave earnestness with which the writer discourses on the education of
youth, the pervading intensity of moral purpose, and the love of freedom
that finds expression in what seem to be compromising and even dangerous
utterances. In short, the epoch of the Dialogus, its contentS, and the
writer’s method of treating his subject all tell in favour of the belief in the
authorship of Tacitus. As to the style, a public man in the Rome of
Tacitus’s day, who would have frequent occasion to speak in the presence
of others, must have had at command an easy, simple, flowing, and pleasing
method of expression, such as that which we find 'in the Dialogue—
where, moreover, there is, as might have been expected, an artistic
adaptation of the external form to the characters and sentiments of the
different interlocutorS. The difference in style is to be accounted for by
the difference of subject. The writer could not have used, for such
a work, the compressed, epigrammatic, and sometimes even enigmatical
language of the Annals.

Lange's views were combated by, among otherS, H. Gutmann in
a dissertation which Orelli incorporated in his edition of the Dz'alogue
(Turin, 1830) ¹. The writer bases his acceptance of the conclusions of
F. A. Wolf partly on chronological grounds, and partly on the internal
evidence of the substance and style of the Dz'alogue. Tacitus is known
to have been praetor in A. n. 88, and this office was not usually (at least
in republican times) conferred on any one who had not attained the age
of forty. Gutmann finds it difficult to believe that the historian could
have properly described himself as having been iuvenis admodum in the
year A. D. 74-75. In point of style, the treatise appears to him to
illustrate many of the features of an age of decline3 and while recognizing
the interest and value of much of its contentS, especially Messalla's
utterances about the upbringing of the young, he so far forgets the
dramatic character of the conversation which it reports as ‘to charge
against the writer, rather than the speaker, such obvious sophistries as
those in which Aper indulges in chS. 16 and 17. While giving promi-

translation of the Dialogue: and edition, Stuttgart, 1882.
