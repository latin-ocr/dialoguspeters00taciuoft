36 CORNELII TA CJTJ

Itaque hercule non minus probari video in te, Secunde, quod Iuli

20 Africani vitam componendo spem hominibus fecisti plurium eius
modi librorum, quam in AprO, quod nondum ab scholasticis
controversiis recessit et otium suum mavult novorum rhetorum
more quam veterum oratorum consumere.’

20. Africani. Iulius Africanus shared
along with Domitius Afer (see on 13. 9)
the reputation of being the foremost
orator of his timet Quint. x. 1, 118 and
xii. 10, 11. He was a native of Gaul-—
a son of the Africanus whom Tacitus
mentions (Ann. vi. 7) as ‘e Santonis Gal·
lica civitate' (Saintonge, to the North of
the lower Garonne): a grandson of his,
also an orator, is referred to by Pliny,
vii. 6, 11.

hominibus, ‘the literary world.'

21. quam in Apro. There is a real
difficulty here. If Aper is included in
the compliment paid above to the ‘viri
optimi,’ &c., on the ground of their wide
literary sympathies, it seems inconsistent
now to say (even in irony) that he wins
approval by sticking to‘ scholasticae con-
troversiae' ε cp. declamatorium studium,
above. On this ground the emendations

‘quarn damnari’ or ‘quarn improbari'
have been proposed. But Messalla is
only saying that Secundus gains fully as
much praise for his literary interests as
Aper does from his circle of admirers for
his devotion to professional rhetoric. The
implied reflexion on the tendencies of the
new rhetoric brings out Aper’s retort.

trasted with the narrow views which Aper
is made here to represent (cp. 2. ad fin.

contemnebat potius litteras quam nescie-
bat) the orators of former days were dis-
tinguished sor broad culture and wide
literary sympathies. For their poetieal
tastes see Cic. Aead. pr. ii. 16, 51 (Serv.
Sulpicius Galba). Plin. Ep. v. 3, 5 (Q.
Scaevola, Hortensius, M. Iunius Brutus,
C. Licinius Calvus). Many of them
studied history and law.

15. 1. Non desinis is Wrongly taken
as an interrogation (⁴ Won' t you give up? ⁹)
with the enclitic omitted, Dr. 5 31. But
nam in the next sentence is against
this.

vetera et, antiqua. The same collo-
cation recurs 16. 32 and 17. ad fin.

4. fratris tui. This was Aquilius
Regulus, his brother probably on the
mother's side. He was one of the most
notorious of the delatores, and is fre·
quently denounced by Pliny (omnium
bipedum nequissimus, Ep. i. 5) both in
that capacity and as a legacy hunter.
His eloquenee is however not denied:
id. Ep. iv. 7, 4: vi. 2. Martial always
mentions him with respect, e. g. i. 12:
vi. 64.

5. oratorem, as opposed to ‘horum
temporum diserti, causidici et advocati et
patroni et quidvis potius quam oratores
vocanturss ch. 1: cp. 14.14‚26. 15, 30.
27, 32. 9.

eo audacius quod, ‘ with all the
greater confidence inasmuch as you had
no cause to sear,’ &c.
