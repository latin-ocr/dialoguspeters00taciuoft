DIALOGUS DE ORA TORIBUS. 107

assidua senatus tranquillitas et maxima principis disciplina ipsam
quoque eloquentiam sicut omnia depacaverat.

39. Parvum et ridiculum fortasse videbitur quod dicturus
sum, dicam tamen, vel ideo ut rideatur. Quantum humilitatis
putamus eloquentiae attulisse paenulas istaS, quibus adstricti et
velut inclusi cum iudicibus fabulamur? Quantum virium de-
traxisse orationi auditoria et tabularia credimUS, in quibus iam 5
fere plurimae causae explicantur? Nam quo modo nobiles equos

18. maxima AB, maximi DCH (Baehrens), maxime Haase, Halm, and edd. ‘ Con-

cinnitas ' seems to be in favour of maxima.

19. omnia depacaverat A, (depara-

verat B), omnia alia pacaverat H and most codd. (Michaelis, Halm, Miiller), alia

omnia pacaverat E.

39. 1. videbitur Ursinus, videtur codd„ videatur Orelli, Halm, and edd.

tur EV2CADH‚ ridear AB.
fabularis: A.

18. disciplina, of the ‘great imperial
system,’ or “constitution': cp. 40. 13
quarum civitatum severissima disciplina:
Hist. iv. 74, 18 octingentorum annorum
fortuna disciplinaque compages haec
coaluit, where G. and G. render ‘ Staats-
ordnung‚' ⁴ Regierungsweisheit.’ So Cic.
de Or. ii. § 67 disciplina civitatis: i. ξ 159
disciplina rei publicae: i. ξ 3 perturba-
tionem disciplinae veteris,—the overthrow
of the old political system.

19. sicut omnia. Alia is added in
many MSS. (cp. 21. 4), but its omission
may be justified by a comparison of Hist.
ii. 80, 5 Caesarem, Augustum, et omnia
principis vocabula: iv. 3, 14 Iudaeam
Suriamque et omnes provinciaS.

damnaverat, &c., ‘ had brought peace
and quietness into’: a ἅπ. εἲρ. formed on
the analogy of delinire, demz'tzgrare. Livy
has ‘ perpacare.’ John points out that the
reading ‘ depacaverat ' is supported by the
preference which the author shows in the
Dialogue for compound forms, especially
verbs compounded with dc· and con-, in
a weakened signification: e. g. 7. 17
demonstrare = monstrare: 22. 25 deter-
minare=terminare (16. 17 is different):
87. 35 desumere=sumere (10. 36). Cp.
also 10. 11 denegavit, deterream: 6. 15
consurgere=surgere z 15. 12 conquirere =
quaerere.

39. 1. videbitur seems the better
reading—certainly with rideatur follow-
ing. 6Vz'deatur is, however, supported by
16. 2 .

2. vel, ⁸ even if only,’—even if I achieve
no other result than to raise a laugh,
though the matter is really one about

2 . ridea-

5. tabularia ABDH, tabulariae V2C (tabularz'q E),

which we ought to feel shame and humi-
liation. Cp. Quint. iv. 1, 33 non tamen
omittenda vel ideo ne occupentur: ib. x.
1, 86, 131 (vel ideo quod). Similarly
Hist. iv. 49, 31 vel forte: Agr. iii. 16 vel
incondita ac rudi voce, where vel =‘ even
if onl .'

Quyantum humilitatis, &c. Tr. ‘ How
much have we done to abase eloquence
b ,’ ὅτε.

γ3. paenulas. The paenula was pro·

perly a rough sleeveless cloak, of wool
or leather, worn in rainy weather. See
Mayor’s note on Juv. v, 79. It fitted
closely to the body, whence adstricti et
velut inclusi. The dignity of the legal
profession must have been in danger
when counsel took to appearing in this
cloak instead of the toga. A modern
barrister might as well address the bench
in an ‘ ulster.'

4. fabulamur: cp. 23. 11.

5. tabularia, ‘offices,' properly ‘ re·
cord—offices,'—chambers which, like the
auditoria, would have been considered
in earlier days unsuited to the majesty of
the laW. The ‘basilicae’ were found
inadequate for the rush of business which
followed the late disturbances: Suet.
Ves . 10.

6.Ρ fere. It is sometimes difficult to
see whether fere is meant to attach itself
to a single word (Reid on Lael. ξ 2) or
to a whole sentence. Here it might be
joined to plurimae, ‘pretty well most' ι
cp. Cic. Tusc. iii. ξ 73 ‘fere plerique.’
This is, however, much more common
with ‘fere omnes ' : and it is safer to take
fere here as modifying the whole state-
