3. Most edd. (following Schulting and

Ritter) give aut C. Laelio aut C. Carboni, on the ground of a comparison of 25. 31 ς
but the addition of aut C. Laelio seems unnecessary.

lione mediis divi Augusti temporibus
habitae (sc. orationes). But on the whole
it seems improbable that any one who
took the trouble to insert such an inter-
polation would have failed to make it
correct.

in medium usque. Nowhere else
does Tacitus use in . . . usque in a tem-
poral seuse; and Gudeman uses this as an
argument for the elimination of the paren-
thesis: he also challenges the change
from in to ad. Quintilian has ‘ in illum
usque diem‚' ‘usque ad ultimum‚’ and
many similar expressions.
Α 27. duravit = vitam perduxit: cp.
Ann. iii. 16, 8 narratum ab iis qui nostram
ad iuventutem duraverunt, and possibly
also Agr xliv. 15 durare in hanc beatissimi
saeculi lucem. The word cannot possibly
have any other meaning: cp. Quint. i.
§ 21 inde durat ad nos usque, and fre·
quently.--In order to saveAper's accuracy,
it has been proposed to take duravit as
refloruit, and to understand it as indi-
cating the period during which Corvinus
and Asinius continued in full activity at
Rome. But though Pollio may have done
little in public after about 17 Β. C.‚ we
know from Suetonius (Aug. 58) that it
was Messalla who, in the year B.C. 2,
proposed in the senate that the title
Pater Patriae should be conferred on
Augustus. This fact has been made an
argument for reversing the names, still
taking duravit as = floruit, so that it
would be Corvinus, not Asinius, who
‘ paene ad extremum duravit.' So John
and Wolff ε but duravit can'hardly stand
the interpretation thus given.

ne dividatis, ‘so that you must not
make two ages out of one.’ The expres·
sion really implies an ellipse, sc. haec
dico ne: cp. Quint. x. 1, 45 facile est
autem studiosis qui sint his simillimi

iudicare, ne quisquam queratur, &c., ‘ ⁴so
that no one need complain.' Gudeman con-
tends that the removal of the parenthesis
makes the ellipse more natural and easy.

28. quos. For the omission of the
demonstrative, cp. 5. 15 studium quo.

²9· coniungere et copulare, i. e. with
the present day. The meaning is· thus
given by Orelli ε ‘ quos una hominum
aetas, qui memoria sua totum vitae
spatium amplectuntur, agnoscere ac velut
coniungere potuit cum eis quos ad ultimam
iam senectutem provecta nostris tempori·
bus vidit.’

18. 1. fama. gloriaque. These syno-
nyms are frequently found together t e. g.
Sall. lug. iv. 6 famam atque gloriam.

2. temporibus adquiritur: lit. ‘ac-
crues to the times,’ or is reflected on them.
Cp. Hist. ii. 76, 8 cui summum decus ad-
quiratur.

in medio sitam (positam), ‘common
property‚' i.e. common to both epochs.—
The great extension of the use of such
adverbial phrases (cp. in proximo 16. 27)
in post-Augustan times points to the
influence of Greek analogy (ἓν κοινῷ, &c.):
cp. in obscuro, in ambzguo, in promiscuo,
in aequo, in communi.

3. Servius Sulpicius Galba, consul
B.C. 141, was one of the contemporaries
of Laelius and Scipio the Younger. He
was prosecuted in B.C. 149 sor atrocious
cruelty and treachery to the Lusitanians,
but secured an acquittal, though the
charge was supported by Cato the Censor
(Cic. de Or. i. ξ 227, Brut. ᾖ 89). As an
orator Cicero ranks him very high : e. g.
Brut. ξ 89 Sed inter hos . . . sine contro·
versia Ser. Galba eloquentia praestitit: de
Or. i. ξ 40 divinum hominem in dicendo.

G. Papirius Carbo, consul Β. C. 120.
He had originally belonged to the party
of Ti. Gracchus, but deserted it for the
