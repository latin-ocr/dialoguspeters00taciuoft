THE Dz'alogue on Oratory has long been one of the puzzles of literary
antiquity. In no other work, of similar character and scope, is the student
confronted by so many problems, the more tantalizing because some of them,
at least, seem incapable of any final settlement. The circumstances of the
re-appearance of the treatise in the middle of the fifteenth century, the long
war that has been waged over the question whether it is a genuine work
of TacituS, its relation, in point of style and date of composition, to the
other writings of the historian, its aim and purpose, its original form and

in fact an almost entirely neglected work. This is all the more to be
wondered at as, with the exception of the Letters of Pliny, no contempo-

the less familiar writings of Seneca, the two Plinys‚ and Quintilian. It is
the best introduction, especially for younger readers, to the historical
works of Tacitus himself, which require for their full understanding
a riper judgtnent and a greater faculty of literary appreciation than is

needed for the prose authors by whom they are preceded in the ordinary
