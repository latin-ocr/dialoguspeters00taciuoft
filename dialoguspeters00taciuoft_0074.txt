MANUSCRIPTS.

IT is a well-known fact that, with the exception of CatulluS, no classical
author has come down to the modern world by so slender a thread of
transmission as Tacitus, The first six books of the Annals rest upon an
absolutely unique manuscript, the famous First Medicean, which was not
recovered for a generation after the appearance of the first printed edition
of his works, being commonly believed to have come to Rome from the
monastery of Corvey in Westphalia, about the year 1508 ¹. For eighty
years previously, the codex now known as the Second Medicean, con-
taining the last books of the Annals and the ffi'storz'es, had been in the
hands of scholars. Poggio had received it, at Rome, from his friend and
agent, Niccolo Niccoli, in the year 1427, but does not seem to have kept
it long, as he was anxious to obtain in its place another codex which he
had once seen, and which he thought a copyist would have less difficulty in
transcribing. His mysterious allusions to its provenance, and the general
secretiveness which marks his correspondence with Niccoli on this
subject, suggest an explanation of the phenomenon that it was long
before its contents became generally known ². It had probably been
procured under circumstances rather compromising to its new owner.

Intermediate between the re-appearance of these two codices comes
the discovery of the minor works of Tacitus, including the Dialogue‚
shortly before the year 1460. Some have thought that the codex con-
taining these must also have been in Poggio’s possession, though he had
kept it a close secret till his death in 1459, in the same way as he had
agreed to treat the manuscript received from Niccolo Niccoli. But the
