as to'the whole purpose of the Dz'alogue, are removed, or at least lessened,
by the theory that Tacitus followed Cicero’s example in not introducing
living personages. However this may be, Maternus is undoubtedly the
protagonist of the piece. It is through him that Tacitus gives expression
to his own thoughts. The future historian saw that his work, too,

would be done, not in the bustle and racket of the forum, but in quiet
retirement. His regret for the old free-state was tempered‚ like that of

Maternus, by a practical acquiescence in the necessity for the empire.
It is his voice we seem to hear when the poet-pleader expresses his
preference for Vergil’s life of repose (malo securum et quietum Vergilii
secessum, 13. 4), and when, at the end of the debate, he points out that
every age has its own advantages (nunc quoniam nemo eodem tempore
adsequi potest magnam famam et magnam quietem, bono saeculi sui quisque
citra obtrectationem alterius utatur, ch. 41 ad fin.). It is, in fact, by the
closing speech that the so-called ‘ republicanism ’ of Maternus is reconciled
and harmonized with existing political conditions.

Other theories of this closing speech have been put forward by editorS,
and remain to be considered. In this edition it is attributed to MaternuS,
not only on the evidence of the manuscripts, but on other grounds as
well. It is in it that we find the fullest expression of that spiritual
sympathy between speaker and writer which was evidently Tacitus’s
motive in making Maternus the main personage of the piece. He is,
as has been said, the protagonist‚ with whom the discussion begins and
with whom it ends. It has not been noted by any commentator that
the true explanation of the placid manner in which, in the introduction,
Maternus meets the hasty criticisms which are being advanced against
his ‘ Cat0,’ is to be found in his consciousness of his own position. In
the first place, these criticisms are nothing but the outcome of popular
gossip; fabulae malzgrnorum as they are styled even by the cautious
Secundus¹ (3. 4). Aper does not seem to attach much weight to his
friend’s alleged indiscretion 3 to him it is simply an ‘ outburst of his
noble soul ' (effervescit vis pulcherrimae naturae tuae), all the more dis-
interested because it was connected with the name of one so far removed
from present-day controversies (privatas et nostri saeculi controversias)
as Cato. Aper would not shrink from a similar indiscretion himself in
defence of a friend: si quando necesse sit pro periclitante amico potentiorum
aures offendere, et probata sit fides et libertas excusata, 10 ad fin. As for
Maternus himself, he has no fears on his own account, no apprehension
that any action will be taken against him. His innocence has hitherto
