SUBSTANCE AND SCHEME OF THE DIALOGUE.

WE may now endeavour to obtain an idea of the contents of the
Dz‘alogue, though the attempt to analyze its substance must necessarily
anticipate some of the problems which will require to be dealt with
subsequently.

The treatise may be taken as consisting of three main partS, to the
first of which is prefixed an introduction (chs. 1-4) setting forth the
circumstances in which the conversation narrated is said to have taken
place, while the third is finished off with a concluding chapter (42)
describing the breaking up of the company.

The first part of the dialogue proper extends from ch. 5 to ch. 13,
and contains two speecheS, one by Aper, the other by Maternus,

The second part begins with the entrance of a new member of the
company, Messalla (ch. 14), and again contains two speecheS‚ one by
Aper, the other by Messalla. It ends with an interruption by Maternus
in ch. 27.

The third (chs, 28-41) is the most important section‚ as dealing
with the real subject of the treatise. It contains the great lacuna, the
existence of which (and the hypothesis of another) has given rise to
a great difficulty in regard to the distribution of the speakers’ parts.
Messalla is the main disputant from ch. 28 up to the point at which
his discourse is lost, at the end of ch. 35. At ch. 36 another speaker
begins, though the first part of what he says is also lost. There is
nothing in the external form of the text to show that he is not Maternus
(as would naturally be supposed from the words Finierat Maternus,
ch. 42), or that the speech from ch. 36 to ch. 41 is not a continuous
whole. But a nearer consideration of the general scheme of the
