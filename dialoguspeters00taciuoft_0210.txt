of forensic pleading, it was the practice
for a patronus to conduct the whole case
entrusted to him single-handed,' Ramsay,
Rom. Ant. p. 312. Afterwards there
might be¹several patroni3 Murena was
defended, for example, by Cicero, Hor-
tensius, and Crassus, and in later cases
we hear of three, four, six, and even
twelve advocates.

Β. C. 52, when Pompey was for five months
sole consul, ‘corrigendis moribus delectus)

His enactment limited the speech for the
prosecution to two hours, and that of the
defendet to three: cp.Cic. Brut. ξ 324 lege
Pompeia ternis horis ad dicendum datis:
ib. § 243 illius iudicialis anni severitatem:
de Fin iv. 1, 1. ‚Even before Pompey's
legislation, something seems to have been
done towards curtailing the length of the
speeches. In his impeachment of Verres,
Cicero speaks of the time accorded to
him by law (⁶ legitimae horae‚' ii. 1, 9. 25):
while in the pro Flacco he mentions six
hours as the time allowed for the prose-
cution (sex horas lex omnino dedit, ξ 82).
It was probably the neglect of these enact-
ments that provoked Pompey's statute.
Under the Empire the time allotted to
counsel seems to have varied at different
periods. At the trial of Marius Priscus,
Pliny spoke for five hours (dixi horis paene
quinque, Ep. ii. 11, 14). On another
occasion six hours were allowed to the
accuser and nine to the accused: cum e
lege accusator sex horas novem reus ac-

cepisset, Ep. iv. 9, 9. while in vi. 2, 5
we hear of so few as two clepsydrae, one
clepsydra, and even half a one being

asked for and granted. That these re·
strictions were felt to be irksome we may
infer from what Pliny says elsewhere. ‘si
modo iustum et debitum tempus accipiat,
quod si negetur nulla oratoris maxima
iudicis culpa est,' Ep. i. 20, 10.

15. pro heredibus Urbiniae. This
was a case in which an adventurer called
Clusinius Figulus alleged that he was the
son of the deceased Urbinia, and laid
claim to her estate. Quint. vii. 2, 4—5.

ab ipso tamen Pollione, ‘ and even
these Pollio delivered ,' &c. The point is
that it was only when political passions
had subsided that orators of standing
could afford to interest themselves in
private cases,
