2. potentium, i. e. Vespasian, and the
circle of favourites referred to in ch. 8.
His treatment of Helvidius Priscus shows
that even the mild founder of the F lavian
line could resent the exhibition of repub-
lican sentiments. For the expression, cp.
Quint. ii. 20, 8 cum periculosa potentium
offensa.

tamquam c. subj. is often used by
Tacitus (like quasi and velut) to introduce
an opinion or statement advanced by
others (Draeger 5 179; Wfflfflin, Philol.
xxiv. 115-123): 10. 27 tamquam minus
obnoxium sit. Cp. Ann. 1. 12 ad fin

‘invisus. ‚tamquam plus quam civilia
agitaret: ii. 84, 3· . ‘tamquam misere-
rentur ' Agr. xxxviii. 7.

in eo tragoediae argumento =in eius
tragoediae argumento. For the inversion
cp. Cic. in Verr. ii. 4 ξ 100 permotus illa
atrocitate negotii.

3. sui oblituS, ‘without thinking of
himself, ’ i. e. of the risk he was running.
'lhere is no imputation that Maternus
forgot or belied his character for out-
spokenness and plain dealing This is
evident enough, —in spite of his general
mildness, and his acquiescence (40.) 111 the
limitations imposed on contemporary elo-
quence—from his reference to his early
success with Vatinius ( 11. 10), his appre-
ciation of the ‘antiqua libertas’ (27. 12),
his caustic remarks about Crispus and
Marcellus (13. 10), and his calm an-
nouncement of his Thyestes (3. 11): see
Introduction p. xxxviii. In any case such
an imputation would have been a strange
one to make against a dramatic poet. The
fact is that sui oblitus, while antithetical
in form, is really subordinate to tantum
Catonem cogitasset. There is thus no
need for the otherwise ingenious conjecture
obsequii, which might however be defended
on palaeographical grounds.

Catonem . . . cogitasset = Catonis
mentem induisset et expressisset, G. and G.

Cogi‘tare 15 of course frequently used with
an acc„ but the parallels cited by editors
are hardly so strong: cp. however Seneca,
de Ben. iv. 31 dum veterem illum Scaurum
cogitas: Plin. Ep. iv. 2, 2 Incredibile: sed
Regulum cogita.

5. Marcus Aper, like many other rhe-
toricians of this period, was of Gaulish
origin (cp. 10. 6 ne quid de Gallis nostris
loquar). From ch. 17 we leam that he
had served in Britain, possibly, like
Tacitus's father-in-law Agricola, under
Suetonius Paulinus. By the date at which
this Dialogue is supposed to have taken
place (74-5) he had already made his way
to the praetorship. See Introd. p. xxxii.

Iulius Secundus was also a Gaul, but
a man of a different stamp from Aper.
He was much admired by Quintilian, who

and 3 ξ 1 2, where see my notes. From the
former of these two passages it seems that
he was dead when Quintilian wrote his
Tenth Book. He is probably identical
with the rhetorician mentioned by Plu-
tarch as Otho’s chief secretary ε Σεκοῦνδος
ὃ ῥήτωρ, ἐπὶ τῶν ἐπιστολῶν ’γενόμενος τοῦ
Ὄθωνος (Otho 9). See Introd. p. xxxv.

celeberrima . . . ingenia.. Cp. Quint.
Χ. 1. 122 sunt enim summa hodie, quibus
inlustratur forum, ingenia (Aper, Mar-
cellus, Matemus‚ Aquilius Regulus, Pliny,
and Tacitus himself).

6. quos ego non modo . . . audie-
bam. 1 base the reading given in the text
not only on the consistent usage of
Tacitus in non modo clauses (G. and G. p.
854 b), but also on the fact that it explains
the corruptions of the MSS. In Tacitus,
non modo always stands in close relation
to the word or words which form the
antithesis,—-here in iudiciis, which cannot
be a gloss. Nipperdey was therefore
nearly right in suggesting, ‘ quos ego non
in iudiciis modo utrosque ’ ς but it is more
