margin of the Partis-tensis at the place indicated by Pithon. But the
author of the note was not the copyist of that late manuscript, but the
scholar who wrote the Harleianus‚ where it will be found in the rubric,
f. 23 ν. The same is true of the marginal direction at ch. 9 Σημειώσον
τὰ ἤθη, and of the words Nemus el lucus Poetarum which are written in at
the end of the same chapter ¹.

Though it is impossible to say how the MS. now in the British
Museum came into the hands of Ambrose Bonwicke‚ we are fortunately
able to determine the name of its first owner, and consequently its
approximate date. On the first folio of the Suetonius fragment appears
a coat of arms which Mr. Warner succeeded in identifying as those of
John Tiptoft, the literary Earl of Worcester (d, 1470). Tiptoft acted as
ambassador to the Pope and Council of Mantua in 1459, and returned
to England towards the end of 1460, after using the opportunity afforded
by his residence in Italy to get together a valuable library ². In Florence
he was taken in hand by the bookseller Vespasiano ⁸, and attended
incognito a lecture by the renowned Argyropulos. This would be about
the time when Enoch’s discovery had brought the Dialogue and the
Suetonius fragment, as well as the Germania, to Florence‚ and when
scholars were busy in emending a text that was admittedly corrupt.
What more natural than that the English collector should have wished
to secure a copy in which, however, the first two treatises were alone
included, owing to the similarity of their subJ'ect matter? The upper limit
for the date of Tiptoft’s acquisition of the copy in question is fixed by the
time of his sojourn in Italy: the lower limit is determined by the date of
his execution, October 18, 1470, after which his arms would not have
been added to the codex ⁴². Another factor in the calculation is the

¹ It may be noted here that none of
these occur in the V indobonensis (V).

² Bale in his account ofTiptoft (p. 620)
gives a list of his works‚ and adds a quo·
tation from a funeral oration of Ludovic
Carbone of Ferrara, in which among
other things he says literarum avidissimus
omnes, ut ita dixerim, Italiae bibliothecas
spoliavit ut pulcherrimis bibliorum monu-
mentis A ngliam exornet.

⁸ For Vespasiano's account of Tiptoft
see his ‘ Duca di Worcestri ' in Spicilegium
Romanum, vol. i. (1839) p. 524.

¹ We know that Tiptoft intended to
leave the manuscript under consideration,
along with others, to the Bodleian Library
at Oxford (see Macray’s ‘Annals of the
Bodleian,' p. 11 and p. 400). But his
intention was not fulfilled, and historians
of the period mention it as matter for
regret that we have no information as to
what became of his literary treasures:
see Voigt‚ Wiederbelebung des elassischen
Alterthums, ii. p. 260. In these circum-
stances the identification of Tiptoft‘s coat
of arms becomes of some importance, and
