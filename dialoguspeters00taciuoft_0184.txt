5 quorum professio quando primum in hanc urbem introducta sit

7. dicturus. The fact that this promise
is not redeemed till 35. 2—not till after
Messalla has made a fresh beginning of
his speech, need not cause much difficulty.
Such incongruities may be held to give
even a greater air of reality to dramatic
discourse. At the end of 32 Messalla
‘ pulls himself up,’ as it were, more or less
abruptly, and it is only on resuming his
remarks that he remembers to refer to
the promise made here.—This explanation
renders superfluous all the laboured
emendations of the critics (non latius dic-
turus, N ipperdey3 iam non persecuturus,
Michaelis ; est alienum decurrere, Knaut;
securus statim, Meiser and Baehrens) based
on the belief that Messalla is mentioning
the matter only to pass it by: it also
negatives the view of those (Peter, An-
dresen‚ and others) who think that Mes·
salla refers to the immediate sequel, in
which, while proceeding to speak of the
all—round character of the old training, he
points at the same time, indirectly and by
implication, to the low esteem in which
the schools of rhetoric were held in
former days. Usener and Baehrens even
go the length of reading ‘introductast
quam‘ for ‘introducta sit quamque,' re-
cognizing the fact that, at the most, the
sequel can only be held to contain an
answer to the ‘ quam . . . habuerit ’ clause:
against them John rightly points out
that, in that case, the usage of Tacitus
would have led us to expect cum instead
of quando primum.

The corruption of dicturus into the
decuriis of the MSS. is supposed by
Helmreieh to point to a marginal gloss

7. dicturus Gronovius, de curiis codd.

(de curis priorum oratomm) intended to
indicate the subject of the following
passage: cp. 30. 27, where C gives ‘ ornate
quid orator et ' for ‘ ornate et‚‘ while in
the rubrio there is Quid sit oratoris pro-
prium (Quis orator H. De ffcio ora-
toris B .

prige. Cp. Quint. viii. 3, 41 Ceterum
dicturus quibus ornetur oratio, prius ea
. . . attingam. John adds Hieron. Ep.
149, 3 de Pascha paulo latius aliquid
dicturus prius ostendere volo, and holds
that prius is an indispensable insertion as
it indicates the purely temporal relation
between dicturus and refiram.

10. eontinentur, i. e. evidence of it
may be found in their own writings‚ as Cic.
Brut. lxxxix—xcii. For this use of ‘con-
tineri,' cp. Ann. i. 11, 15: Hist. v. 13, 8.

14. Q.. Mucium. The reference is to
Q. Mucius Q. F. Scaevola, the Augur,
as is evident from Brutus ς 306: ego

212, Philipp. viii. §31- This Scaevola
was the friend and son-in-law of Laelius,
and the father-in-law of the orator Crassus.
He was born about 160 13.e.: went to
Asia as praetor in 121: was consul 117:
and died after 88. He is one of the
interlocutors in the de Oratore (see
Wilkins, Introd. p. 21 sq.)‚ the de Re
Publica, and the de Amicitia. The family
