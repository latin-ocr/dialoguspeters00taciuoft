 

THE QUESTJON OF AUTHORSHIP AND DATE. xxi

artzum domina pulcherrimo comitatu pectora implebat nunc . . . quasi
una ex sordidissimis artificiis discatur. The habit of ethical reflection
and shrewd psychological observation which manifests itself repeatedly in
the historical books is already at work in the Dialogue: 8. 27 dzbztzae et
opes, quas facilius invenies qui vituperet quam qui fastidiat ,· 13. 4
adligati omni adulatione, nec imperantibus unquam satis servi videntur
nec nobis satis liberi ,· 18. 15 vitio autem malignitatis humanae vetera
semper in laude, praesentia in fastidio esse ,· 23. 16 prope abest ab
infirmitate in quo sola sanitas laudatur ,· 37 ad fin. in ore hominum . . .
quorum ea natura est ut secura vellicent ,· 40. 5 cum . . . ad incessendos
principes viros, ut est natura invidiae, populi quoque ut histriones auribus
uterentur. Such an expression as ut est natura invidiae, though it
may of course be paralleled from other writers, has a sort of family
likeness to quae natura pavoris est, stt. iii. 84, 203 cupidine ingenii
humani libentius obscura credendi, ib. i. 22, 16; ut ferme acerrima
proximorum odia sunt, ib. iv. 70, 12, and many other phrases familiar to
students of Tacitus The closing deliverance of Maternus, ch. 41 ad fin.
nunc, quoniam nemo eodem tempore adsequi potest magnam famam et
magnam quietem, bono saeculi sui quisque citra obtrectationem alterius
utatur reminds the reader of the famous utterance in the Agricola
(4 2, 18) sciant quibus moris est inlicita mirari, posse etiam sub malis
principibus magnos viros esse, obsequiumque ac modestiam, si industria
ac vigor adsint, eo laudis escendere quo plerique per abrupta, sed in
nullum rei publicae usum, ambitiosa morte inclaruerunt. The sentiment
of acquiescence in the necessity for the rule of a single man, which finds
expression in this closing speech, is another clement in the identification:
the whole political tone¹ is quite consistent with that which we know
was adopted by Tacitus. Again, that feeling of regret for the past which
seems to have entered into the very composition of the historian’s genius
is exemplified in the poet-pleader's first speech (ll-13), with its beautiful
picture of a golden age (cp. Ann. iii. 26). But it is in the sphere of
moral sentiment that the resemblance is most pronounced. Messalla’s
lament over the oblivio moris antiqui (28. 6) is fitly put into his mouth
by the writer who made even his Germania an opportunity for introduc-
ing weighty reflections on the moral decadence of Rome. Here Messalla
speaks for Tacitus,—the Tacitus whom we know from his other workS.
When the speaker bewails the general effacement of the ‘good old
wayS,’ the shamelessness of the present day (29. 7), the decay of careful
moral training at home (29. 2), he is uttering the sentiments of the writer
