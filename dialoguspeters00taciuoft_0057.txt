Such defects as attached to the curriculum through which the youth of
Rome was made to pass in the days of Tacitus (Dz’al. chS. 30-33) were
remedied and corrected, in his case, by the appreciative study' of the
great models of former timeS, especially Cicero. Of this study the Dz'alogue

{1 bears obvious traces», and nothing will strike the reader so much,

 

especially at first, as the studied resemblance which its style bears to that
of the great orator. It was while Tacitus was full of a generous enthu-
siasm for Cicero and his contemporaries that he is represented as having
listened to the conversation which the treatise embodies and expands;
and at the date at which it is supposed to have been written his style was
still under the influence ‘of his early studies and pursuits¹. It waS, in
fact, still in what may be called its first stage. In all probability, Tacitus
had modelled his earliest efforts at the bar, as nearly as was possible
after such an interval, on'the oratory of Cicero and his great contem-
porarieS. It was this, no doubt, that drew Pliny to him, and led him to
select his friend as an example to be followed ². Their early association
must have been partly, at least, based on a kindred sentiment of reverence
for the past. Now it is a known fact that Pliny was one of Quintilian's
pupils (Epp. ii. 14, 9; vi. 6, 3), and it is interesting to speculate on the
probability that Tacitus too had come under the influence of the great
rhetorician. Quintilian had returned to Rome, from Spain, in the train
of Galba, and probably lost little time ³ in commencing the educational
career with which his name has ever since been so closely associated.
Tacitus may even have been one of his earliest pupils. Chronology
seems to favour the supposition, and the numerous points of contact
which exist between the two writers add to its probability. It may have
been from Quintilian himself that Tacitus imbib'ed that antipathy to
mechanica] methods and the tinsel ornaments of unreal disputation which
reveals itself in Messalla's speecheS, as well as that belief in the superiority
of Cicero which he evidently shares with the same speaker. Quintilian's
mission at Rome, then and afterwardS, was to recall the literature of the
day from the studied affectation and empty elegance that were then held
