³ *incidents as these, however regrettable in themselves, were far more
⁵ , inspiring than the routine practice of police-courts and petty-sessions.
Political and social disturbance is the best stimulant for oratory. Every
·  one knows that peace is to be preferred to war3 but it is war that brings
out the soldier. So it is with eloquence (chs. 37, 38).

J Again‚ the forms of judicial procedure and the practice of the law-
, courts were more conducive to good speaking in former days. Then
” apleader could take as much time as he liked, and there was a very
{3 <wide freedom of adjournment. And the centumviral courtS,—the great
sphere of forensic oratory now‚--were formerly of little account: they
J were eclipsed by the brilliant surroundings of other tribunals (splendore
’ aliorum iudiciorum obruebantur). Morever, the habit of speaking in
the paenula, and in chambers or officeS, is not favourable to oratorical
animation. The stimulus of an audience is wanting, and the incitement
2 of applause: things are not now as they were in the days when the
forum was crowded with an interested assemblage, when deputations
² came up from the country-towns to show their interest in a case,—cum
in plerisque tudiciis crederet populus Romanus sua interesse quid iudicaretur.
. And in former times the frequent public meetings, and the notoriety to
be gained by the impeachment of distinguished individuals, supplied
= a great stimulus. Again must the truth be stated: eloquence thrives
on disorder. Non de otiosa et quieta re loquimur et quae probitate et
modestia gaudeat, sed est magna illa et notabilis eloquentia alumna licentiae,
’ quam stulti libertatem vocabant, comes seditionum', effrenatipopuli incitamen-
, tum, sine obsequio, sine veritate, contumax, temeraria, adrogans, quae in
j bene constitutis civitatibus non oritur. At Athens, where power lay in
1 the hands of the multitude, orators were numerous3 at Rome, in earlier
'' days, there was greater oratorical vigour‚ but the country had a heavy
price to pay in the attempted revolution of the Gracchi and in the
death of Cicero (chs. 39, 40).

’ 'From this point of view, the surviving traces of the old forum are only
ἶ a proof of a society that falls short of ideal perfection. In the ideal
' state, free from all taint of wrong-doing, the orator will be as super-
1⁸] fiuous as the'physician among those that are not sick. Minor oratorum
honor obscuriorque gloria est inter bonos mores et in obsequium regentis
paratos. The transference of power from the popular assembly to the
emperor (saptentzlssimus et unus), with all the consequent changes, has con-
s„ tracted the sphere of eloquence. Circumstances alter cases, If you, my
Α friends (the speaker concludes), had lived under the republic, and if the old
orators had changed places with you, you could not have failed to
achieve the highest oratorical renown‚ while they would not have been
