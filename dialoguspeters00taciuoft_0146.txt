11. tres et viginti. Tiberius reigned
from Aug. 19, A. D. 14, till his death on
March 10, A.D. 37.

prope quadriennium,
March 16, 37 to Jan. 24, 41.

12. ,Claudii et Neronis. The former
reigned from Jan. 25, 41 to October 13,
543 the latter from the date last-named
to June 8 or 9, 68.

13· longum et unum annum: (cp.
solus et unus, 34. 30) a memorable
characterization of the eventful year
in which the legions assumed the con-
stitutional functions of the senate and
people of Rome, ‘ evulgato imperii
arcano, posse principem alibi quam
Romae fieri ‘ (Hist. i. 4, 9). Cp. the
introduction to the Histories ε esp. ch. ii.
‘ Opus aggredior opimum casibus ’ : ch.xi.
ad fin„ ‘ annum sibi ultimum rei publicae
prope supremum.’ If we count from
Nero's death to the downfall of Vitellius
(Dec. 20, 69) the period extends really
over eighteen months ι but it was as early
as in the beginning of July 69 that the
standard of Vespasian was raised in Egypt
and Palestine.

sextam . . . stationem. In late Latin
statio cameto be used for an office or posi-
tion under the government‚ and especially
the principate itself ι Suet. Claud. 38,
Velleius, ii. 124, Plin. Panegyr. 7 and 86:
Antoninus Pius ad F ront. vi. (ed. Naber),
p. 168, hunc diem quo me suscipere
hanc stationem (principatus) placuit:
so ‘ statio imperatoria,’ Lampridius, Life
of Commodus. Cp. Ov. Trist. ii. 219,
‘ scilicet imperii, princeps, statione'relicta.'
Even by Cicero it was employed to indi-
cate, on the analogy of its military asso-
ciafions, a post from which a watch must

i. e. from

44 (of Nero) cum statione peracta Astra
petes serus (‘ when thy watch is over ') ε
Vell. Pat. ii. 131 protegite hunc statum,
hanc pacem, hunc principem, eique functo
longissima statione mortali destinate suc·
cessores quam serenissimos. But there is
a distinct peculiarity here about the use
of stationem with sextam. Perhaps there
is a reference to the fact that the tribunitia
potestas had to be renewed to the emperor
every year, and that on the first day of
every new year the magistrates and
senators took the oath of allegiance (in
aeta iurabant). This would give the
idea of the princeps being confirmed in
his ‘ post ’ from year to year, and taking
over with it, each year, the obligation of
watching over the safety of the realm.
Each year thus formed a statio in the
emperor’s reign. Vespasian began to rule
on Jan. 1, 70, so that he is now in the
‘ sixth stage' of his principate.—Some
propose to take sextam as ‘ sixthly,' ae-
cording to the order of enumeration—(r)
Augustus3 (2) Tiberius; (3) Caligula;
(4) Claudius and Nero; (5) Galba, Otho,
and Vitellius; (6) Vespasian. This would
require a different explanation of statio,
and it is, moreover‚ inadmissible, not
only grammatically, but also as not
giving the definite data required for ‘ in
hunc diem colliguntur.'— With adice,
above, there is a slight zeugma: sex
stationes would have been more regular,
or else we may supply respice, considera,
out of adice.

15. eentum et viginti: ‘only 1203
As a matter of fact, apart from the above
enumeration, 116 years (42 ÷ 74) is the
interval which separates the death of
Cicero from the sixth year of Vespasian's,
reign. See Introd. p. xiv.
