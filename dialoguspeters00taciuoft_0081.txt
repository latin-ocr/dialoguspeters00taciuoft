MA N US CRIPTS. lxix

Pref. p. i) ; but, though this may be true of the rest of his book, it is
probable that he was acquainted with the text of the Dz'alogue as given
in the Harlez‘anus‚ and several instances of true readings hitherto ascribed
to Puteolanus which are anticipated in the British Museum codex will
be recorded in the commentary. Similar emendations and interpolations
are to be found also in the editions of Beroaldus (1514) and Beatus
Rhenanus (1519 and 1533). By employing the Farnesz‘anus (C),
Lipsius put the text of Tacitus on a new basis in his great edition
of 1574, the popularity of which may be estimated from the fact that no
fewer than ten re-issues of the work, revised by Lipsius himself, appeared
at Antwerp and Leyden between 1574 and 1607. The last of these
embodied the improvements made on the text by Pichena: and about
the same time the labours of MuretuS, Pithon, and Acidalius combined
to purge the Dz'alogue in particular of many of the blemishes which even
then remained upon it. The edition of Gronovius (Amsterdam‚ 1672 and
1685) does not indicate any independent advance. For the Dialogus,
Brotier went back to the MSS„ and used the four Vatican codices (1862,
1618, 2964, and 4498) without, however, recognizing the supreme
importance of Vat. 1862 (A). The codex Farnesz'anus (C) still held the
first place, not only in Brotier's eyes, but in those of Heumann (Gottingen,
1719), Schulze (Leipzig, 1788), Dronke (Coblenz, 1828), Orelli (Zfirich,
1830), and Bekker (1831). Next, Egger ‚collated the codex Parz'sz‘ensz's
7773, which, however, will be shown below to be a mere copy of the
Harleianus (H). In his edition of 1841, Hess gives the readings of the
Vindobonensis (V) as reported by Schubart. In the same year came Tross’s
collation of the very important codex Leidensz’s (B), which had formerly
belonged to Perizonius, Of this codeX, Ritter made a fresh collation for
his complete edition of Tacitus (1848), and it was thereafter allowed to rank
above the Farnesz‘anus (C). But almost at the same time the Vaticanus
1862 (A) begins to emerge. Nipperdey was the first to demonstrate its
superiority (Hall. Litt. Zee‘t. 1840), and in his edition of the Germania
(1847), Massmann suspected that it must stand on at least a footing
of equality with B. The same line was taken by Reifferscheid in his
Quaestz'ones Suetonz'anae (see especially pp. 409 sqq.)‚ and lastly‚ by
Michaelis, in his critical edition of the Dz‘alogue (1868). Michaelis
had examined A for himself in the year 1858, and had come to the
conclusion that it was ‘integrior' than Β. To A and B he adheres
closely, as against the Y family of MSS. Baehrens, on the other hand,
constructed his critical edition (1881) on the theory that the Y family
contained a truer tradition than that of which AB are the representa-
tives: and this theory, taken along with his own tendencies towards
