horror through which Tacitus and other true Romans lived in indignant
silence. Like Nero, Domitian had his ‘quinquennium’ 3 and it lasted
even longer than Nero'S, though he was throughout his whole reign
gloomy and sombre, if not always actively cruel. ‘His conduct,’ says.
SuetoniuS, ‘ was at first a mixture of good and evil, but little by little
his virtues became vices: need rendered him avaricious‚ fear made him
cruel,'—2'nopz‘a rapax, metu saevus (Dom. § 3). If he would have been
likely to visit with punishment a writer who, in the early years of his

own reign, indulged in some of the outspoken sentiments which we find in
the Dialogue, he would have been just as likely to act in the same way

towards one who had written and published during the short reign of his
immediate predecessor. It must have been quite as safe to tell the story
of the meeting in Maternus’s house, and of how the poet-pleader de-
clared his intention of going on with his ‘republican’ tragedies, at
a time before the temper of the new ruler had showed itself, as it would
have been in the year immediately before Domitian came to the throne.
For with the inclination to connect the contracted sphere of eloquence
witli the loss of political freedom, there co-existed in the mind of
Maternus, as will be shown afterwards, a general appreciation of the
compensating advantages which the empire had brought in its train‚ and
a due regard, in particular, for the benefits conferred on Rome by so
wise and upright a ruler as Vespasian (41. 17). The ground of his
confident attitude is, in fact, disclosed in his concluding speech. More-
over, we know that Domitian was a patron of literature. Suetonius tells
us that he instituted the Quinquatria Μἠενυαε, with contests in poetry
and rhetoric. He used to preside at the quinquennial festival of Jupiter
Capitolinus, at which both poets and prose writers recited their produc-
tions, the most successful being decorated with golden crowns. Quin-
tilian enjoyed under Domitian the same imperial patronage and favour

that had been ‘extended to him in the previous reigns of Vespasian and
Titus. It is difficult to believe, therefore, that the new emperor's accession

to the throne was the signal for a youthful literary aspirant like Tacitus at
once to close his lips in silence. Whether it was published immediately,
or shown at first only to a few intimate friends, we seem to be almost
forced, by the conditions of the problem, to infer that the Dz’alogue was
written about the year 84—85. Such a theory gains, in the first place,
a sufficient interval ¹between the date of composition and the historic
frame-work, while, on the other hand, it allows a sufficient length of time
for the development of the style of Tacitus as we afterwards know it. If
the Dz'czlogue was published at once, it is just possible that the long silence
which Tacitus maintained during. the reign of Domitian may have been*
