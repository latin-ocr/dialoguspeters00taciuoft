found wanting in the moderation and sels-restraint that are called for
under existing conditions. It is here that we must look for the recon-
ciliation of opposing views. Great oratorical fame is inconsistent now
with the settled calm which pervades the state: let us be thankful for
the latter without disparaging the conditions under which the former
was attainable: nunc quoniam nemo eodem tempore adsequi potest magnam

samam et magnam quietem, bono saeculi sui quisque citra obtrectationem
alterius utatur (ch. 41).

Messalla would have liked to state some points in reply (he was
a more thorough-going champion of the old order), and to enlarge on
others. Maternus promises him an opportunity. For the present, he
bids Aper farewell, threatening that he will tell the poets about him,

And so they part, in great good-humour.

THE INTERLocUTORs AND THEIR PARTs.

THE unity of the Dz'alogue has been the subject of much discussion,
No two editors are altogether agreed about its scheme or plan, and even
its main motive has been called in question. We cannot pretend to
determine now the extent to which the treatise embodies a conversation
which may have actually occurred—how far it has a historica] foundation,
and how far it is the product of the writer's imagination. There can be
no doubt, however, that it rests on a certain basis of fact. The dramatis
personae are all historical personages3 and even though they may all have
been dead at the time when Tacitus wrote, he would not have been likely
to invent all the circumstances of the meeting at which they are repre-
sented as having interchanged views with one another. But we cannot
meet the charges that have been made against the construction of the
treatise, against its unity of plan and purpose, by taking refuge in the
argument that it is simply a narrative, as accurate as the writer’s recollec-
tion could make it, of a conversation which actually took place, and which
he reports exactly as it occurred. In that case, no greater unity could
