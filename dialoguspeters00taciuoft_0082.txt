arbitrary and irresponsible emendation, enabled him to produce a text
which presents many points of contrast to that of Michaelis. Binde, in
a dissertation to which reference will be made again (1884), supported
the view of Michaelis, with variations. The latest contribution to the
criticism of the Dialogue has been made by F. Scheuer (1891), wh0, in
a pamphlet to which all future editors will continue to be indebted,
endeavours to establish the superiority of the Y family, though on other
grounds than those on which Baehrens had relied.

Before proceeding to a more detailed consideration of the subject of
the distinguishing characteristics of the two familieS, it will be advisable
to furnish here a more specific account of the various codices to which¹
reference has already been made.

Of Vaticanus 1862 (A), nothing need be said in addition to what has
already been stated, except that the order of its contents is (ι) the
Germania, (2) the fragment of Suetonius, and (3) the Dialogue. It
was doubtless a faithful copy of the manuscript from which it was
transcribed.

The Leidensis (B), on the other hand, in which the Dialogue comes
first and is followed by the Germania and the Suetonius, presents several
points of interest and peculiarity. It was long supposed to be the
‘actual copy made from Enoch’s codex by Jovianus PontanuS, the intimate
associate of Alfonso the MagnanimouS, who played a large part in the
literary society of the N aples of his day1. It is now admitted, however,
that B is not the original apographon of Fontanus, but a copy of it. It
differs considerably from A, though it is impossible now to say how sar
the difference is attributable to the changes introduced by Pontanus him-
self, and how far to the copyist of Β. Pontanus is known to have been an
elegant and accurate scholar, and he no doubt incorporated many emen-
dations in the text as he transcribed it. Moreover, the scribe sometimes
makes corrections in his own hand, some of which are right, while others
are wrong 2. Lastly‚ the whole was subsequently revised by another hand,
cited as b, the author of which is generally supposed to have had other
