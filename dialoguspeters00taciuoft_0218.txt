periclitantibus eat? Credite, optimi et in quantum opus est
20 disertissimi viri, si aut vos prioribus saeculis aut illi quos miramur
his nati essent, ac deus aliquis vitas ac [vestra] tempora repente
mutasset, nec vobis summa illa laus et gloria in eloquentia neque
illis modus et temperamentum defuisset: nunc, quoniam nemo
v eodem tempore adsequi potest magnam famam et magnam

utatur.'

25 quietem, bono saeculi sui quisque citra obtrectationem alterius

42. Finierat MaternuS‚ cum Messalla: ‘ Erant quibus contra
dicerem, erant de quibus plura dici vellem, nisi iam dies esset

exactus?

“Fiet' inquit Maternus ‘postea arbitratu tUO, et si qua tibi
5 obscura in hoc meo sermone visa sunt, de iis rursus conferemus.'

20. illi Halm, isti codd.

21. ac deus codd., Halm: aut deus Baehrens.

[vestra] Halm, Baehrens, tempora vestra Haase, vitas vestras ac tempora Bekker.

Qy. vitas· vestras et vetera tempora? E gives et for ac.

regentis, above, praecipientium 28. 6:
dicentium 6. 18. So often discens, audiens,
docens, διο. Cognoscere occurs in the
same sense at 19. 2 3, where see note.

19. in quantum opus est, i.e. con-
sidering the limited field now open to
eloquence. Cp. 1. 11 disertissimorum, ut
nostris temporibus, hominum.

21. ao deus aliquis, &c. Baehrens
and, on different grounds, John prefer to
read ‘aut deus aliquis,' δια, and there is
perhaps a certain want of logical pre-
cision in the way in which the writer
presents what is really intended as a dual
alternative. The first hypothesis is,-ac·
cording to John, the transportation of
one of the two parties (aut vos . . . aut
illi) into the age of the other: the second
the simultaneous reciproca] exchange of
epochs (deus . . . repente mutasset). But
it is possible to be too exacting in the
way of precision of statement: the ac
deus . . . mutasset clause seems rather to
have been added in the way of an after-
thought: Novak indeed, following Mul-
ler's suggestion, rejects it altogether, as
having been added by some one who
remembered the well-known passage in
Horace (Sat. i. 1, 15).

vestra is rightly rejected by many
editors as superfluous: its position also
renders it open to suspicion. It could

25. bono codd.: huius

only mean ‘yours and those of the antiqui:
whereas, immediately before and after, vos
is used of those whom the speaker is
addressing alone.

25. eitra. See on 27. 9. Maternus
concludes with an attempt to reconcile
the conflicting views of Aper and Messalla,
while justifying himself, in the altered
conditions of the time, for preferring
poetry to rhetoric.

alterius involves a brachyology. Tr.
‘ Let every one enjoy the blessings of his
own age, without disparaging those of
any other.’

42. 3. exactus, ‘far-spent': so Agr.
xxxviii. 12 exacta iam aestate: ib. iii. 5
exactae aetatis: Hist. iii. 33, 4: iv. 84, 5.
For the same idea of ‘ completing’ a
thing, cp. also Lucan, Phars. ii. 577
Ante bis exactum quam Cynthia conderet
orbem: ib. viii. 376.

4. arbitratu tuo. Cic. Brut. §42 At
ille ridens ‘ Tuo vero ' inquit ‘ arbitratu’ :
de Am. ξ 3 arbitratu meo. So too fre·
quently in Livy. The nominative and ac-
cusative singular are found only in Plautus.

5. de iis . . . conferemus. This is
an unusual construction. Cicero often
uses ‘inter se conferre,' but always with
the acc. or with a dependent clause: ad
Att. i. 20, 1 Si quid res feret, coram inter
nos conferemus, de Fin. iv. ἓ 4. Cp.
